About the "kreplacements"-directory:
====================================

I want to be able to compile and use KDiff3 without KDE too.
Since KDiff3 is a KDE program, which uses many KDE-classes and
functions there must be some replacement.

In many cases this is just the corresponding Qt-class, but often
I wrote something myself. For several very KDE-specific functions
there is no real replacement, but only stub functions that allow
the program to compile and link.

This stuff is not intended to be used for anything else but KDiff3.
Think of it rather as a big hack, that only has the advantage
that I need not mess up the normal program with many ugly
#ifdef/#endif-clauses.

Most include files in this directory only include kreplacements.h
where the actual declarations are. The implementions are in
kreplacements.cpp.

The *.moc-files are dummies. The new KDE-philosophy seems to be
that *.moc-files are directly included into the sources.  
The Qt-philosophy still is to generate moc*.cpp files which will
be compiled seperately. With these dummy-moc-files both versions
can be compiled.
