----- WARNING ------------------------------------------------------------------

The style option "Wider entries in menubar" enables a HACK --i.e. a trick-- of 
which the effects CAN NOT BE TOTALLY REVERSED on the running applications.

In clear, when activated, the menubar HACK enlarges the entries and removes the 
spaces in between them. If you activate then deactivate it, only the spaces in 
between the entries will be restored but the entries in the menubar of the 
applications on which ones you already saw the effects of the hack will NOT 
become narrower.

To totally disable it, you must DEACTIVATE IT in the configuration dialog THEN 
RESTART KDE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This HACK is HARMLESS, there is *virtually* no way it can make your KDE crash. 
It has been working on my system for a long time without a single problem but 
it does really strange things to the menubar entries, things that a style 
shouldn't do --even in my own opinion.

I could have made it totally reversible but I didn't because it would have 
meant activating another hack to reverse its effects. The way it's written 
assures you that Serenity does not-so-clean things *only* when the hack is 
activated.

Try it, if you like what it does, keep it. Otherwise, disable it and restart 
your KDE.

NOTE: If you know an application that changes the labels of a menu entry during 
its execution, for example, to add a number or whatever, please REPORT to me. 
I don't know any and that's the only situation where this hack may cause some 
*cosmetic* problems... or worst.
