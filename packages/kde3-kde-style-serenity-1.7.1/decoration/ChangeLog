----- ChangeLog ----------------------------------------------------------------
1.7:
	- Partial re-design of the configuration dialog to give you a better 
	control over the colors of the buttons and their symbols. You can even 
	set the power of the eventual color mixes used.
	- You can now also set the color of the buttons when pressed. 
	- The standard highlight color is now available for both the hovered 
	and activated buttons.
	- Four titlebar style are now available: No background, solid 
	background (both as previously), solid top and softer edge.
	- The windec also got brightness routines similar to the ones of the 
	style so that the buttons all look the same. 

1.6:
	- Conflicts in between maximize, resize and redraw solved.
	- Problem with shaded maximized window solved. (The window is 
	de-maximized if you shade it.)
	- You can now also choose the color of the colorised buttons and 
	symbols, either from the color list or from the colorscheme (title 
	blend and title button icon). So they can all have a common color 
	instead of each one using its own glow color.
	- The windec also got the new soft zen gradient.
	- Config dialog re-designed to match Serenity style's one.
	- Fixed the problem that led the buttons to walk on the outline of the 
	window with the minimal border size.
	- The zen border now only use the window background color and it's 
	coming back onto the inactive windows so that the borders don't look 
	like blinking anymore.
	- Added the possibility to choose window text to draw the window 
	outlines. So they automatically match with the various panel frames 
	--but without the eventual colorization so they remain different.
	- Removed the B2/BeOS frame shape that was only a fad and slowed down 
	everything.
	- The windows are now always square when fully maximized, all you have 
	to choose is whether you want to keep the borders or not.

1.5:
	- The mouseover color can be made purer so that the glow color of the  
	hovered buttons is less blended with the background.
	- A solid bar using the titlebar color can now be drawn behind the 
	buttons and the caption. It takes part in the color of the buttons.
	- Serenity's own gradient routines got accelerated.
	- Configuration dialog totally re-designed to give more room to the 
	preview and to the options at the same time.
	- The number of button types has been reduced to only four: "Buttons",
	"Toolbuttons", "Solid frame" and "Flat buttons".
	- Each button type can now be colorised with the glow colors.
	- The symbols can be hidden unless hovered or pressed, but you can keep 
	the closer and/or the menu.

1.4:
	- The wide buttons now always have an even size so that the icon is 
	always centered.
	- A new icontheme has appeared: "Classic", with very standard icons.
	- The patch against the memory leak applied to the style has been 
	applied to the window decoration too --although no memory leak has been 
	detected.
	- An extra 2-pixel spacing can now be inserted in between the buttons.

1.3:
	- The Zen borders around the buttons are now smoother.
	- The Right-To-Left layout should be supported now.
	- A little color change for the toolbutton-style buttons --when hovered.
	- No more caption flickering. (I hope!)
	- The window Zen border now appears only on the active window.
	- The option "No frame if maximized" now reduces the titlebar to the 
	strict minimum: only the buttons and the caption without any space 
	around.
	- The 1-pixel space in between the buttons has disappeared.
 
1.2:
	- The window borders got enlarged for usability reasons
	- And so does the titlebar for aesthetic reasons.
	- The window frame can now adopt a pseudo-3D look which gives it a 
	little volume.
	- The number of gradient styles is now only 3: "Serene" (diagonal), 
	"Zen" (pseudo-3D) and "Flat".
	- Serenity automatically tries to shorten the title as much as possible 
	if it is wider than the available space in the titlebar.
	- Some minor color changes that nobody should notice.

1.1:
	- Three new button styles.
	"Colors only": No symbol is visible on the buttons unless hovered or 
	activated. The buttons are differentiated thanks to their glow color.
	"Colored buttons": Similar to "colors only" plus the symbols in a color 
	matching their button.
	"Colored toolbuttons": Like "Toolbuttons" --No visible button unless 
	hovered or activated.-- but with symbols drawn with their glow color.
	- That's why there are now as many different glow colors than the 
	number of supported buttons.
	- Any button can be enlarged independently of any other option.
	- Serenity windec now uses its own (faster) gradient routines.
	- The framing around the title text can be deactivated so that only the 
	buttons look like buttons.

1.0:
	- The window frame isn't uselessly 2-pixel thick any more.
	- A new button style for the titlebar is available: Toolbutton i.e. no 
	button is visible unless hovered or activated.
	- The defined window frame color can now be used instead of the one 
	calculated by Serenity.
