The Serenity style started its life as a patch of Lipstik style from 
Patrice Tremblay and evolved from there on with code inspiration taken 
from the sources of Plastik, DotNet, QtCurve, HighContrast, Keramic, 
and probably some others. Thanks to their respective authors. I also 
took some inspiration from the sources of KDE 3.5 and Qt 3. Thanks to 
the KDE developers and all my gratitude gets to the Trolls of Trolltech 
who made all this possible.

The Serenity window decoration was based on my previous work: Powder.
