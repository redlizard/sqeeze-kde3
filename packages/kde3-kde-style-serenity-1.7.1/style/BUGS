----- KNOWN BUGS ---------------------------------------------------------------

The mouseover effect does not always react as programmed. It is activated 
when it should not or it remains activated after the mouse has left the 
widget. Apparently Qt does not always detect that the mouse leaves a widget. 
The only way around is to let the mouse cursor enter and leave the widget area 
again until Qt dectects it.

The mouseover effect on toolbox tabs can be activated on all tabs in some 
occasions --when it shouldn't. I think it happens during some massive redraw 
but I haven't be able been to reproduce this bug at will.

The taskbar buttons work as expected only when they are set to behave like 
toolbuttons i.e. the option "Show button" in Taskbar must be set to "on mouse 
hover and click". I haven't been able to do any better yet.

OpenOffice 2 does not support the "arrowless" scrollbars and there are some 
widgets which are incorrectly drawn --no mouseover effect, wrong colors, etc.
