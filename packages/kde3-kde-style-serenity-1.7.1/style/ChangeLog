----- ChangeLog ----------------------------------------------------------------
1.7.1:
	- Bugfix for KDM.
	- Textbox focus highlight activated by default for the login.

1.7:
	- The character used in the password entry boxes in now a big dot 
	instead of the asterisk.
	- Scrollbars and sliders do not sink under a mouse click any more.
	- Tabbar improved with new gradients and new colors. Four styles are 
	now available for both the active and inactive tabs.
	- Tabs are a bit less busy. They now only change of color under the 
	mouse.
	- Menubar slightly changed with new gradients and new colors. Six 
	styles are now available.
	- Gradient menubars are now a bit less busy too.
	- Textboxes (which include also editable comboboxes and spinwidgets) 
	can now be highlighted when they have the focus. (That's more visible 
	than only the blinking cursor.)
	- The popup sub-menu delay can now be raised up to 1 sec. (That gives 
	you the time to *feel* you have to click to let a sub-menu appear.)
	- Serenity now has its own brightness routines so that you can have 
	white buttons. (Still doesn't work perfectly with black buttons.) 

1.6:
	- A new tree view style is available: "Modern". (Button-less expanders,
	no branches, and expanded branches look like dotted lists.)
	- The slider handles now totally match the look of the arrowless 
	scrollbar handles --including the little arrows.
	- Progress bars slightly re-designed with now three shades of color.
	- Major internal re-factory that increases the speed of all the button 
	and frame drawings, plus some more improvements in the bitmaps handling 
	to gain even more speed.
	- Focus rectangles fixed so that they don't leave traces when you move 
	an icon in Konqueror's window.
	- The rubberband can now be made more visible with the highlight color 
	(that must not be dark or it ruins the effect).
	- Zen style improved, much smoother.
	- The active toolbox tabs respect the tab style (again).
	- Configuration dialog re-designed --just to look nicer.
	- To get rid of the greys, a new global tint can be defined to colorize 
	everything but the texts.
	- The inactive tabs can now be solid (again) to make them more visible.

1.5:
	- Some more frames have disappeared.
	- Fixed the menubar in KControl colors module (wrong color) and in 
	Opera (holes through the window).
	- The branches in the tree views can now be made less visible or 
	totally invisible.
	- The mouseover color can be made purer so that all hovered widgets get 
	approximatively the same color.
	- The active tab can no longer have a button look, only a gradient or 
	flat look. The active tabs also got subtly improved.
	- The inactive tabs can now be separated instead of joined. In both 
	cases they now use a gradient to be "lighter".
	- The panel resizers/splitters can now be made less visible or totally 
	invisible unless hovered.
	- A fourth very discreet menu groove has appeared.
	- The framing of the sub-menu arrows can now be deactivated. In that 
	case, the arrows are bigger.
	- Serenity's own gradient routines got accelerated.
	- The configuration dialog now always acknowledges all changes. (The 
	"Apply" button wasn't always enabled after a change.)
	- The configuration dialog has been totally re-designed to hold all the 
	new options.
	- The colors of the scrollbar can now be changed. You can choose in 
	between three colorschemes: "Window backgroung" (as before), "Standard 
	background" (usually lighter), and "Button".
	- The design of the sliders (as in KMix) can now be made wider to look 
	like the scrollbars, with the handle inside the groove.

1.4:
	- Memory leak fixed.
	- Progress bars slightly changed.

1.3.0:
	- The menu groove can be deactivated again, or else you can choose 
	another very discreet groove.
	- The toolbars handles can be deactivated again too.
	- Serenity now takes care of the tooltips. They are now readable even 
	with white text and their background color can be selected within 
	certain limits.
	- Konqueror file tips also follow the design of the tooltips but the 
	colors won't be respected (yet) with white text.

1.3:
	- The Zen style has now smoother borders.
	- Some more widgets got supported: The panel resizers in e.g. KNode and 
	Kopete, the tiny panel buttons in KNode, the tiny menu buttons in the 
	Kicker panels.
	- The panel resizers have been re-designed to be more visible.
	- The scrollbars now respect a little more any (unofficial) CSS-defined 
	colorscheme on HTML pages, especially the groove doesn't always keep 
	its default color.
	- The drawing of the tiny surface with zen gradients has been fixed.
	- Menubar usability hack: The entries can be wider, without any space 
	in between them. (See 'WARNING'.)
	- No more tiny tree expanders, they are now as big as possible.
	- New totally flat column headers with little separators.
	- Serenity configuration totally re-worked. Attention: Some of your 
	current settings will be reset to default values.
	- There are also a few less options: The toolbar handles are always 
	visible, as well as the menubar groove, the serene groupboxes can't be 
	deactivated any more and the separators are always solid.

1.2:
	- The number of gradient styles is now only 3: "Serene" (diagonal), 
	"Zen" (pseudo-3D) and "Flat".
	- The progress bars now use colors matching with the window background.
	- The drawing of the tabs has been fixed --especially the bottom tabs-- 
	and the (selectable) gradients are more "serene".
	- The toolbox tabs have been simplified and they follow the settings of 
	the regular tabs (when selected).
	- The separators in the tab bars and in the scrollbars have been 
	improved.
	- The drawing of the radiobuttons has been fixed. (Minor color error.)
	- A new colorscheme: "Caloris Planitia".

1.1:
	- The spinwidget arrows are deactivated when they can't be used i.e. 
	when the spinwidget has reached its minimal or maximal value.
	- A click on a label with a shortcut activates the related widget. 
	(Experimental feature. It works but don't rely on it.) 
	- Popup sub-menus can be accelerated (to open almost immediately) or 
	slowed down (so that they don't open unless you actually keep the mouse 
	cursor over the entry or click it).
	- Four new serene colorschemes have been added.
	- The KMultiTabBarButtons which used a wrong button type are fixed.
	- The incorrectly thick focus rectangle of the QToolButtons is fixed.
	- Tab warnings restored. You can still deactivate them, or have either 
	bold or italic text, or else have the application default color.
	- Serenity now uses its own (faster) gradient routines.
	- The progress bars got new --less flashy-- colors.
	- They can also become flat to be even more "serene".

1.0:
	- The menu autoclose feature is reactivated i.e. you can click the 
	entry of an opened menu to close it.
	- Various styles are now available for the active tabs: Either 
	button-alike (as previously) or a vertical gradient. In both cases, 
	they can use the highlight color or not. Or else you can make them 
	absolutely flat.
	- Tabs can now be centered.
	- QToolButtons fixed. (Only K3B & Kaffeine, AFAIK)
	- A new scrollbar style is available: Arrowless i.e. without arrow 
	buttons at each end of the scrollbar.
	- The separators --including in popup menus-- can be either solid or 
	with vanishing ends.
	- A few color changes, especially in order that only the buttons use 
	the defined button color.
	- Some code optimizations.
