----- INSTALL ------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Installation from the console:

	$ cd path/to/serenity-1.7

	$ ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`

	$ make

	$ su

	(as root)
	# make install

If configure fails, check that you have both
the Qt and KDE development headers installed.

If they are installed but not found, try:

	$ ./configure --help

There are a lot of options to tell the configuration 
script where things are, especially: 

--includedir=DIR		(KDE includes)

--with-qt-dir=DIR		(the root of Qt)
--with-qt-includes=DIR  	(the Qt includes)
--with-qt-libraries=DIR 	(the Qt library)
