This is the KWinDecoration extracted from SUSE 9.3/10.0.

I just changed the title bar icon to the debian logo ;-).
Meanwhile there are some additional options to change the logo,
titlealignment, sharp/round edges etc..

It is called SUSE2 in the KDE control center.
You should also adapt your colorscheme,
there's provided an example as SUSE2.

Have a lot of fun!
