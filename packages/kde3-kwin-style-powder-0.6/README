Powder is a window decoration for KDE 3.x based on my previous original 
Porcelain windec engine.

I got inspired by some plasmoids mockups I saw once. Unfortunately, this 
windec has no transparency like the plasmoid had/have/will have. What I 
really wanted to implement for this windec was a transluent frame under 
the buttons and the title, and all around, but X.org doesn't allow such 
effect... yet.

About the colors: Powder only uses the title text color, the titlebar 
background and the window background. All other colors are calculated 
according to the contrast setting of the config dialog and --of course-- 
the defined glow colors. Just check the provided colorschemes and you'll 
see.

To have the old button icons, just replace the new "powderclient/pixmaps.cpp" 
with "powderclient/pixmaps.cpp.OLD".

Well, I hope Powder is something never seen before. Enjoy it! ;-)
