-- ChangeLog ---------------------------------
0.6:
	- Double click on menu button now close the window.

	- On request, the windows can keep their rounds corners even when 
	maximized.

	- Config dialog re-worked. There's room for some more options.

0.5:
	- Shaded windows are now more compact and better looking.

	- The buttons glow the same way on active and inactive windows.
	That's also better looking.

0.4:
	- KeepAbove and KeepBelow now have a different icon when activated.

	- Button icons slightly changed.

0.3:
	- KeepAbove and KeepBelow buttons are now working although --since 
	nobody complained-- nobody uses them.

	- Inverted glow effect is now working. Much better on a bright
	titlebar with dark text. (Try it with the colorscheme Powder::Snow!)

	- Two different lightnings: Top left --as previously-- and from top.
