.B wv2-config
[\fB\-\-prefix\fP[=\fIDIR\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIwv2-config\fP is used to determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fIwv2\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIwv2-config\fP accepts the following options.
.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
If specified, use DIR instead of the installation prefix that \fIwv2\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix is not specified.  This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation prefix will be
written to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-\-exec\-prefix\fP=\fIDIR\fP
If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fIwv2\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
If no DIR is specified then the current installation exec prefix will be
written to standard output.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIwv2\fP on standard output.
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program against
\fIwv2\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program that
uses \fIwv2\fP.
