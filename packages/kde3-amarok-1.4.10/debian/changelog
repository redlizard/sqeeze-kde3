amarok (1.4.9.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make amarok depend strictly on the same source version of amarok-common (=)
  * Add support for hotkeys under GNOME (Closes: #460113):
    - Add 16_gnome_multimedia_keys.diff patch (patch from Ubuntu, thanks to 
      Chris Brown and James Westby). Adds gnome_media_keys script.
    - Make amarok-common suggest python-dbus and libdbus-glib.
    - Add entry to README.Debian that python-dbus and libdbus-glib are needed
      to get the script working.
    - Add and patch Makefile.am to enable installation of the script.
  * Properly support Xiph mime types (patch from Ubuntu, thanks to Daniel
    Hahler and James Westby) (Closes: #488699).
  * Improve audiocd support from konqueror menu (Closes: #488680). Based on
    patch from Ubuntu (thanks to Anthony Mercatante and James Westby) with
    the following changes:
    - No distro branding.
    - Rename and install the 'play_audiocd' script to /usr/share/apps/amarok.
    - Remove bashisms from the play_audiocd script: /bin/sh compatibility.
    - Enhance play_audiocd script. Some assumptions there were not valid.
    - Install the script to the amarok-common package.
    - Patch amarok/src/amarok_play_audiocd.desktop instead of providing own
      version (19_amarok_play_audiocd.desktop.diff).
  * Add last.fm "Recommended Radio". Patch from Ubuntu (Closes: #488698).
    Thanks to Daniel Hahler and James Westby.
    - Extend the patch. Add "Recommend Radio" to the Playlist menu too.
  * Remove KDE*3* from the amarok package description. When I added it, I
    planned the KDE 4 version too (Closes: #488692).
  * Do not use quilt options (-p0) (Closes: #484942).

amarok (1.4.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add 15_temptables_more_indices.diff patch which creates more indices for
    some temporary tables that are used extensively while building collection
    database. Apparently, SQLite 3.5.x is slower than 3.4.x when doing
    matches on unindexed temporary table fields. This should solve (or improve
    situation significantly) major performance problems with SQLite 3.5.x
    (Closes: #479068). Urgency medium because this problem affects many 
    lenny and sid Amarok users having rather large (15k+ songs) collections.

amarok (1.4.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - The last.fm dialog did not always properly disable options when the
      username was not entered.
    - Fix Amazon Cover fetching by using their new web service api.
      (Closes: #474186)
    - Don't insert items into Dynamic Mode that don't exist.
    - If unavailable tracks are in the Playlist and random mode is on, don't
    - stop those tracks if selected; continue with available tracks.
  * Repackage original tarball as orig.tar.gz instead of doing tarball-in-orig
    tarball thing. The previous way made patch testing and debugging more
    painful unnecessarily.
  * Resynchronize patches:
    - 11_bug403340_cancel_rename_when_deleting_items.diff - fix offsets.
    - 97_automake_cleanup.diff - adopt to upstream changes, fix offsets.
  * Improve debian/rules stamp-automake and clean targets a bit not to rm
    automake generated files uselessly (if they were not regenerated)

amarok (1.4.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove Adeodato SimÃ³ from Uploaders by his request. Thank you Adeodato for
    all your hard work!
  * Remove amarok-gstreamer.install because there is no gstreamer engine
    anymore.
  * Remove overrides/amarok-arts. arts engine is no longer available.
  * Drop internal cdbs/kde.mk in favour of the one shipped with cdbs. Merge
    missing functionality (cvs-make/automake) into debian/rules.
  * Auto-guess automake /usr/share directory.
  * Rework interdependences among amarok and its engines' packages:
    - Drop amarok-engine virtual package. Amarok and its engines ABI are not
      even compatible between Amarok point releases so virtual package, which,
      unfortunately, is versionless by definition, is not practical here.
    - Rename engine packages to amarok-engine-$engine. Make them conflict
      and replace previous amarok-$engine packages. Also make amarok conflict
      with amarok-engine virtual package. All these changes will ensure that
      partial upgrades from etch are not allowed (Closes: #432219).
    - Make amarok depend on any of its engines of the same binary version
      via alternate dependences. Default engine is amarok-engine-xine. Edit
      amarok-engine-xine description accordingly.
    - Make all amarok engines recommend amarok strictly of the same binary
      version. Recommends instead of Depends here breaks circular dependency
      (Closes: #368485).
    - Downgrade amarok-engines to amarok Suggests.
    - Convert amarok-engines package to arch:all because it's a metapackage.
      Edit amarok-engines description because it's no longer going to be
      installed by default.
    - Add amarok-yauap to amarok-engines Suggests.
  * New binary packages:
    - amarok-common - arch:all package for architecture independent files
      split from amarok. It recommends amarok (>= ${source:Version}) to
      avoid circular dependency as in case of stricter "Depends" relationship.
    - amarok-konqsidebar - split konqsidebar into its own binary package. The
      reason for this is that it's incompatible with konqueror (>= 4:4.0.0)
      and needs to _conflict_ with it (due to *.desktop files). Add
      amarok-konqsidebar to amarok Recommends and amarok to amarok-konqsidebar
      Depends.
    - amarok-dbg - package with debugging symbols (Closes: #368840).
    - amarok-engine-yauap - Yauap Commandline Audio Player engine
      (Closes: #445371):
      * Add libdbus-qt-1-dev to Build-Depends
      * Pass --with-yauap to configure
      * Add amarok-yauap.install
      * Depend on yauap.
  * Add "Homepage" field to debian/control source section, remove homepage
    reference from amarok binary package description.
  * Disable /usr/share/doc/amarok-* symlinks in debian/rules. They just
    complicate packaging unnecessarily and make lintian unhappy.
  * Ship only README from upstream source in /usr/share/doc/amarok.
  * debian/README.Debian: remove a note about installing ruby, because it's
    a dependency and gets installed anyway.
  * New patches:
    - 01_libtool_update.diff - use ltmain.sh and libtool.m4.in from Debian
      libtool. This patch is used instead of previous `cp` in debian/rules,
      because the patch 02_ below depends on it.
    - 02_admin_cleanup.diff - admin/* cleanup patch.
    - 97_automake_cleanup.diff - automake cleanup patch to get rid of excess
      dependencies and shut dpkg-shlibdeps up. Superseeds previous
      03_no_libadd_in_convenience_libs.diff patch.
    - 11_bug403340_cancel_rename_when_deleting_items.diff - cancel a pending
      'rename' request for the playlist item that is about to be deleted.
       The patch solves a popular crash. (Closes: #403340).
    - 12_devicemanager_dcopcall_no_timeout.diff - do not use timeout for dcop
      calls. It's very unsafe because it might break further dcop calls such
      as the one in the debian bug #432752 (Closes: #432752).
    - 13_lastfm_crash_434835.diff - resolve lastfm crash which could be
      triggered by switching away from lastfm track while it was still
      handshaking or buffering (Closes: #434835). Thanks to Raphael for the
      excelent instructions how to reproduce the crash.
    - 14_ruby_libs_not_scripts.diff - remove #! stanzas from ruby library
      files.
  * Prepend sequence number to the filenames of existing debian/patches/*.
    Edit debian/patches/series accordingly.
  * Move Depends/Recommends on ruby, python & friends from amarok to
    amarok-common since they scripts have been moved here.
  * Add moodbar to amarok Suggests (Closes: #421420). Tweak amarok package
    description accordingly.
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes to debian/control source section.
  * s/XS-Vcs/Vcs/ in debian/control.
  * Drop DEB_DH_SHLIBDEPS_ARGS_amarok from debian/rules. No longer needed with
    recent dpkg-shlibdeps.
  * Build-Depend on debhelper (>= 5.0.0)
  * Add executable permissions for some amarok scripts to make lintian happy.
  * s/.NF/.nf/ in debian/amarok.1
  * Drop DEB_INSTALL_DIRS_amarok from debian/rules. No longer needed.
  * Use more accurate method to exclude (-X) amarok engines from being handled
    by dh_makeshlibs instead of just DEB_DH_MAKESHLIBS_ARGS_ALL = -n.
  * Do not amarok.install /usr/lib/libamarok.so and /usr/lib/libamarok.la.
    They are devel-only and, hence, useless in the private library like
    libamarok case.
  * Install *.lintian files with overrides.
  * Add manual pages: amarokapp.1 amarokcollectionscanner.1 amarok_libvisual.1
  * Do not install COPYING files which are present in some script directories.
    Also remove useless (according to lintian) MacOS X resource fork file
    rubygems/._gem_commands.rb
  * Exclude amarok from amarok-engine-* packages dependency lists.

  * Update variable name in debian/patches/revert-fix-for-bug-116127.diff.

  * Stop placing scripts in /usr/lib/amarok instead of /usr/bin. This is not

amarok (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert fix for upstream Bug#116127: don't give artists whose all songs in
    the collection are part of a compilation their own entry in the browser,
    since that clutters the list unbearably. This is how 1.4.0 behaves.

  * Add ruby to Build-Depends, missed in the previous upload.

amarok (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + upstream removed Moodbar support in this version due to its instability
      problems.  (Closes: #367792, #375940)
    + requires libvisual 0.4, which is not in unstable: drop support for now,
      and request new version in #376615.

  * amaroK now includes Last.fm stream playing support. Introduced changes:
    + update some-binaries-in-usr-lib.patch to cope with new helper script
      amarok_proxy.rb.
    + add an item to description mentioning this feature, pointing out that
      Ruby is needed, both in the description and README.Debian.

  * Link against SQLite dynamically again, since scores work now with it (at
    least my testings confirm so).

amarok (1.4.0a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revised tarball for 1.4.0 (closes: #367897), fixing the following issues:

    + does not botch migration from 1.3 SQLite collections, which in addition
      caused further collection rebuilds to appear empty. (Closes: #368396)
    + correctly closes database connections, thus not failing with "too many
      open files" and deleting the collection after some hours in pause mode.
      (Closes: #368086)
    + audio CDs can be reproduced again. (Upstream #127388)

  * Switch to included SQLite; for some reason, dynamic linking against 3.3.5
    makes scores unfunctional. (Closes: #367468)

amarok (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. The upstream tarball no longer ships the GStreamer
    engine, and aRts support was dropped a while ago, and this upload only
    includes the XINE engine.

    Bugs reported in the Debian BTS fixed in this version:

    + collection is updated at start up. (Closes: #330017)
    + metadata for icecast streams is displayed. (Closes: #349796)
    + the correct charset is used for lyrics URLs. (Closes: #352882)
    + iPods are recognized even after emptying them. (Closes: #350305)
    + non-ascii characters are displayed correctly under non UTF-8
      locales in the konqueror sidebar. (Closes: #353058)
    + last.fm submission queue is flushed after network unavailability
      even if no more tracks are played. (Closes: #344429)

    Regressions fixed since the latest beta:

    + iPod model detection works again, without needing libgpod-cvs.
      (Closes: #364789)
    + filling tags using MusicBrainz works again. (Closes: #364798)

  * Enable Moodbar support, now that Exscalibar has entered unstable.
    (Closes: #364588)

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).

    outputting to aRts, ship the aKode engine in the amarok-arts package.

    Also, GStreamer 0.8 support is dropped in favour of GStreamer 0.10. Update
    build-dependencies and amarok-gstreamer's dependencies accordingly.

  * Use strncpy instead of qstrdup in the patch for main.cpp, so that argv[0]
    is overwritten correctly. This closes: #352171 (amaroK not remembering the
    desktop it was on upon login), and incidentally makes Erich Schubert happy.

  * Drop build-dependency on libgtk2.0-dev now that #353590 is fixed.

amarok (1.4-beta1-r511476b) experimental; urgency=low

  * First beta (plus SVN) for the upcoming 1.4 version packaged.
    (Closes: #352590)

  * Update build-depends to support iRiver iFP (B-D: libifp-dev, libusb-dev),
    and iPod via libgpod (B-D: libgpod-dev; plus libgtk2.0-dev due to #353590).

  * Since lyrics downloading is now implemented in a separate Ruby script,
    promote ruby from Suggests to Recommends, so that functionality is ideally
    not lost. Add a note with this information to README.Debian.

  * Link against sqlite dynamically again, since amaroK 1.4 can cope with the
    restriction explained in the changelog entry for 1.3.1-1 and Bug#326648.

amarok (1.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:

    + fetching lyrics works again. (Closes: #344509)

  * Do not use g++-3.4 in arm, m68k and hppa anymore, sid's g++-4.0 is
    expected to work. (Closes: #342953)

  * Update MySQL build-dependency to libmysqlclient15-dev. (Closes: #343759)

  * Switch patch management to quilt, and make use of patchsys-quilt.mk.

  * Drop build-depends version constraints that are satisfied with stable.
    Drop the ones for kdebase-dev and kdemultimedia-dev as well, which were
    transient and all arches have the minimum required versions in sid now.

amarok (1.3.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.

  * Built against kdelibs4c2a, so installable in sid again. (Closes: #341959)
    Temporarily bump build-deps on kdebase-dev and kdemultimedia-dev.

  * Remove debian/patches/taglib-1.3.1-suffices.diff, since taglib 1.4 is in
    testing and unstable, and I'll be using a backport for sarge packages.
    Bump version constraint in debian/control.

  * Again, update my e-mail address in debian/control, yada yada.

amarok (1.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + last.fm submissions are properly saved on disk while offline again; they
      had been broken by Qt 3.3.5. (Closes: #334469, #337109)
    + includes missing semicolon in amarok.desktop. (Closes: #336026)

  * Update my e-mail address in debian/control.

amarok (1.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release, quickly released to fix a potential crash at
    startup (upstream #114983).

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Tue, 25 Oct 2005 14:55:29 +0200

amarok (1.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release, which makes this maintainer of yours
    immensely happy because a fix for upstream #114195 is included.
    ("Collection scanner ignored files with non-ascii characters").

  * Add libvisual support (closes: #335053). Thanks to Jean-RÃ©my Falleri for
    the heads-up. Changes needed:

    + add libvisual0.2-dev and libsdl1.2-dev to Build-Depends.
    + add libvisual0.2-plugins to Suggests, and mention it in the paragraph
      regarding visualization plugins in amarok's description.
    + add the appropriate snippet to some-binaries-in-usr-lib.patch in order
      to cope with amarok_libvisual installed in /usr/lib/amarok instead of
      /usr/bin, as mandated by Policy.

amarok (1.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + does not loose playlist / podcasts on restart. (Closes: #329878)
    + PostgreSQL configuration dialog no longer shows MySQL's. (Closes: #327630)

  * Updated the Debian menu icons to the new logo.

  * Updated copyright notice, list of authors, and FSF postal address in
    debian/copyright.

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Thu, 13 Oct 2005 00:04:34 +0200

amarok (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 04:14:52 +0200

amarok (1.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use g++ 3.4 in arm, m68k and hppa.

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Tue, 06 Sep 2005 00:21:03 +0200

amarok (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release. Beware, though, that the GStreamer engine has
    been rewritten (!), and ALSASINK SUPPORT REMOVED due to temporary breakage.

  * Use the internal copy of sqlite for now. This fixes the collection being
    non functional with SQLite 3.2.5 due to this version preventing a database
    handle opened in one thread to be used in another. See Bug#326648 for
    reference. (Closes: #326562, #312386)

  * Enable PostgreSQL support (closes: #326612, #326713):

    + debian/rules: pass --enable-postgresql to ./configure.
    + debian/control: add libpq-dev to Build-Depends.

    (Before somebody comes around with the word "bloat" ready, libpq4 is 6
     times smaller than libmysqlclient14.)

  * Regain preciousss "my `grep -c NEEDED` is smaller than yours" karma by not
    using LIBADD in the statusbar convenience lib. The Depends line had gained
    some weight in 1.2.3-1.

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Mon, 05 Sep 2005 20:57:41 +0200

amarok (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release packaged (closes: #323249). Bugs reported in the
    Debian BTS fixed in this version:

    + does not display advertisements in lyrics. (Closes: #321499)
    + pre-amp in the equalizer works with XINE engine too. (Closes: #283750)
    + includes PartyMode. (Closes: #293293)
    + includes equalizer presets. (Closes: #283761)
    + builds fine with GCC 4.0. (Closes: #314779)

  * Updated Build-Dependencies:

    + automake1.6 to automake1.9.
    + libmysqlclient12-dev to libmysqlclient14-dev.
    + temporarily bump version constraint in kdemultimedia-dev and kdebase-dev
      in order to allow an early upload in the middle of the KDE transition.

  * Adjustments to the build-system:

    + do not require TagLib 1.4.0 since it's not in Debian yet (#323280).
    + don't use KDE_FINAL in amarok/src since both MySQL and KDE have had the
      brilliant idea to define a struct/class named "NET".

  * This version links against libtunepimp2c2, so libtunepimp2 0.3.0-4
    breakage does not affect us anymore. (Closes: #318000)

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Sat, 03 Sep 2005 01:42:56 +0200

amarok (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "following Debian Policy is cool, except when it's not" release.

  * New upstream bugfix release:

    + amaroK now correctly displays the name of the first available engine,
      instead of an empty line. (Closes: #307949)

  * The KDE Session Manager can now restore amaroK on login (closes: #302852,
    #308099). Patch amarokapp to set its own argv[0] to 'amarok', since for the
    session manager to restore an application the binary must be in the $PATH.

  * Made the crash handler aware that amarokapp is in /usr/lib/amarok, and not
    in /usr/bin.

  * Include small patch to fix upstream bug 103510 ("systray icon continues
    'playing' after songs end, if 'clear list' was hit while playing").

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Mon, 06 Jun 2005 00:08:28 +0200

amarok (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.

  * This version fixes an important memory leak in the GStreamer engine that
    happened when a radio stream stalled. (Closes: #299931)

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Tue, 29 Mar 2005 01:43:28 +0200

amarok (1.2.2-1) kalyxo-unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release.

  * Added a menu file, plus XPM icons.

  * Switched to tarball-in-tarball for the .orig.tar.gz (which is sensibly
    smaller now, since upstream uses bz2). Added bzip2 to Build-Depends.

  * Build-depend on automake1.6 and libtool, and regenerate configure and
    Makefiles.in at build-time.

  * Use the kde.mk class maintained by the Debian KDE Maintainers, instead
    of the one shipped with cdbs.

amarok (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include patch from CVS to make amaroK bind listening TCP connections to
    the local interface only. Related to Bug#297693, but not the same.

 -- Adeodato SimÃ³ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Fri, 04 Mar 2005 14:54:34 +0100

amarok (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release packaged (closes: #296139). Lots of improvements and
    new functionality, see the changelog or http://amarok.kde.org for details.
    Bugs reported in the Debian BTS fixed with in this version:

    + the search text input element is now cleared when the user writes
      something there. (Closes: #278359)

    + analyzers work with the XINE engine. (Closes: #287091)

  * amaroK's collection can be now stored in a MySQL database:

    + Build-Depend on libmysqlclient12-dev

    + Pass --enable-mysql to configure.

  * amaroK now includes a sidebar plugin for Konqueror:

    + debian/amarok.install:
      - add files for the konqueror sidebar.

    + debian/control:
      - added kdebase-dev as Build-Dependency.

    + debian/rules:
      - exclude konqsidebar_universalamarok.so from dh_shlibdeps, so that
        amarok doesn't end up depending on konqueror. (The plugin will be
        ignored in systems without konqueror installed.)

  * Other changes:

    + amaroK now ships several scripts to enhance it. These are written in
      Python and Ruby, so add those as suggested packages. Added note to
      README.Debian about this, too.

    + removed sqlite3_in_configure.in.patch, no longer necessary in 1.2.

    + added www-browser as an alternative for the konqueror suggests, since
      upstream fixed the code so that the configured browser is used.

    + renamed debian/README to debian/README.Debian, so that it gets
      installed. D'oh!

    + debian/control:
      - remove Build-Dependency on libkjsembed-dev, no longer needed.

    + debian/amarok.install:
      - install amarok.profile.xml into /usr/share/apps/profiles.

amarok (1.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Upload to get rid of the dependency on libflac4, which is not longer in
    the archive (closes: #289344). Urgency set to high as other packages with
    RC bug fixes can't enter testing because of the libflac6 transition not
    being ready.

    + Relibtoolized the package, so that binaries won't link against not
      needed libraries. Introduced disable_no_undefined.patch, many thanks to
      Daniel Schepler for his insight with this (and for providing the patch).
      [This has reduced the number of NEEDED libraries from 45 to 18, libflac
      being among them.]

    + debian/control:
      - version Build-Dependency on libtunepimp2-dev to (>= 0.3.0-2.1).

  * Some new versions of libraries have become available in Debian since the
    last upload:

    + Taglib 1.3 is now in the archive:
      - removed debian/patches/taglib-1.2-suffices.patch.
      - update Build-Depends to libtag1-dev (>> 1.3.1).

    + SQLite 3 is now in the archive:
      - changed Build-Depends on libsqlite0-dev to libsqlite3-dev.
      - pass --without-included-sqlite to ./configure.
      - patch configure.in to check for sqlite3 (>= 3.0). Upstream forgot to
        update this check in the 1.1 series. [sqlite3_in_configure.in.patch]

  * New package relationships:

    + amarok now recommends kdemultimedia-kio-plugins, which is needed to play
      audio CDs.

    + amarok now suggests konqueror, since it's called in the MusicBrainz
      dialog and some other places. (Closes: #282523)

  * Created a README.Debian files with the following:

    + Explain why the amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2 binaries are shipped
      in /usr/lib/amarok instead of /usr/bin, differing from upstream.

    + Describe a fix for the 'Socket-path is not a link or a directory' error.

    + Explicitly mention what is needed to play audio CDs in amarok.

  * Other changes:

    + Patched admin/configure.in.min to include AM_MAINTAINER_MODE. To make
      the .diff.gz stuff smaller, force automake-1.6 (which upstream uses) in
      admin/detect-autoconf.sh. [am_maintainer_mode.patch, automake-1.6.patch]

    + Prevent admin/cvs.sh from creating .gmo files at "make dist" time, since
      those can't be shipped in the .diff.gz. [gmo_files_at_build_time.patch]

    + debian/amarok.1:
      - correct "hyphen vs. minus sign" usage.

amarok (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release packaged. Most notably, fixes several GStreamer
    engine related bugs.

  * debian/control: add to amarok-gstreamer's description that is not possible
    to use artssink for output.

  * debian/rules:
    - call dh_install with --list-missing (DEB_DH_INSTALL_ARGS).

  * debian/patches/:
    - removed proper-otherlang-handbook-path.patch, issue fixed upstream.

amarok (1.1-cvs-0+kalyxo1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. Thanks to Peter Rockai for his initial work.

  * Updated to amaroK 1.1 CVS (2004-09-24):
    - temporarily link statically against libsqlite, since sqlite >= 3.0.7 is
      required and is not available in Debian (requested in #272271).
    - added debian/patches/taglib-1.2-suffices.patch to lower the requirement
      from taglib 1.3 (requested in #273029) to 1.2, which is enough.
    - new package amarok-xine (yet another engine for amaroK, hurray!)
    - added the following Build-Dependencies:
      + libkjsembed-dev (amaroK is now JavaScript scriptable).
      + libtunepimp2-dev (MusicBrainz support).
      + libxine-dev (for the xine engine).
      + libtag1-dev (missing).

  * New package amarok-engines:
    - depends on all the available engine packages and will be installed by
      default unless the user specifies an specific engine.
    - all the amarok-* packages Provide: amarok-engine, and amarok now
      Depends: amarok-engines | amarok-engine.

  * Removed the amarok-xmms package:
    - its single binary amarok_xmmswrapper2 is now included in the main amarok
      package.
    - include some hackery to prevent amarok from depending on xmms (!).
      amaroK just does a no-op and issues a warning on stderr if xmms is not
      installed and user opens the visualizations menu, so this seems safe.
      A xmms-lib package (in which amarok could easily depend) is requested in
      #272913.

  * Install amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2 in /usr/lib/amarok instead of
    /usr/bin:
    - needed for FHS/Debian Policy compliance.
    - added debian/patches/some-binaries-in-usr-lib.patch to fix locations in
      source (amarok/src/loader/loader.cpp, amarok/src/socketserver.cpp).

  * Added lintian overrides for an aRts module which must go in /usr/lib
    despite not being a shared library. noatun and some other arts-related
    packages have the same problem, if someone has a solution please share.

  * Made /usr/share/doc/amarok-* symlinks to /usr/share/doc/amarok.

  * Do not make amarok-arts depend on the meta-package "arts"; the
    dependencies given by ${shlib:Depends} do suffice.

  * debian/control: updated to Standars-Version 3.6.1.
