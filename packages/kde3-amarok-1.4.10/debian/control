Description: versatile and easy to use audio player for KDE
 Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
 interface that really makes playlist handling easy.
 .
 Features include:
   - rapid playlist creation, with drag and drop from a directory view
   - nice playlist browser for your existing playlists (PLS or M3U formats)
   - collection-indexing support, for smart browsing and playlist creation
   - possibility of accessing media via kioslaves, allowing you to play
     via smb:// or fish:// (normal streams are of course supported)
   - inline ID3 tag editing, capable of retrieving tags via MusicBrainz
   - album cover support: automatically displays album covers from the
     filesystem, or downloaded on the fly
   - miscellaneous audio effects, including crossfading
   - easy bindable global shortcuts, rich DCOP interface
   - On-Screen Display (OSD), on track change or at keypress
   - iPod and iRiver support
   - Last.fm stream playing support
   - Track "mood" display (requires moodbar package installed)
 .
 Support for libvisual visualization plugins is also compiled in (you need 
 to have libvisual-0.4-plugins installed to be able to use it).

Package: kde3-amarok-common
Architecture: all
Depends: ruby
Recommends: kde3-amarok (>= ${source:Version})
Suggests: kde3-libqt0-ruby1.8, python, python-qt3, python-dbus, libdbus-glib
Description: architecture independent files for Amarok
 This package contains architecture independent files needed for Amarok to run
 properly. It also provides Amarok documentation. Therefore, unless you have
 'amarok' package installed, you will hardly find this package useful.
 .
 You need to install Python if you intend to use Zeroconf support, WebControl
 and/or playlist2html scripts. You will also need python-qt3 for the
 WebControl script.

Package: kde3-amarok-konqsidebar
Architecture: any
Depends: kde3-amarok (= ${binary:Version}), kde3-konqueror (>= 4:3.0.0), kde3-konqueror (<< 4:3.90.0), ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Amarok sidebar for konqueror 3.x.x
 This package contains the Amarok sidebar plugin for konqueror from KDE 3
 series. The sidebar provides a convenient way for a user to control amarok
 directly from the running konqueror instance.

Package: kde3-amarok-engines
Architecture: all
Depends: kde3-amarok-engine-xine (>= ${source:Version}), kde3-amarok-engine-yauap (>= ${source:Version})
Description: output engines for the Amarok music player
 This package serves merely as a reference point if you want to install
 all available Amarok engines. It depends on those Amarok engines that
 generally can be used by most users. You can safely remove this metapackage
 as you can remove the amarok-engine-$engine packages that you don't use.

Package: kde3-amarok-engine-xine
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Recommends: kde3-amarok (= ${binary:Version})
Conflicts: amarok-xine
Replaces: amarok-xine
Description: Xine engine for the Amarok audio player
 This package provides the xine engine for Amarok. Xine is capable of
 playing most of media formats and usually does not require any 
 additional configuration therefore this engine is default and recommended.

Package: kde3-amarok-engine-yauap
Architecture: any
Depends: yauap, ${shlibs:Depends}
Recommends: kde3-amarok (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Yauap engine for the Amarok audio player
 This package includes Amarok yauap engine, which provides a frontend
 to Yauap Commandline Audio Player. DBus is used as a means of communication
 between the engine and Yauap. Please note that some extra Amarok features 
 (like visualizations) might not be available while using this engine.

Package: kde3-amarok-dbg
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: kde3-amarok (= ${binary:Version})
Recommends: kde3-kdelibs-dbg
Description: debugging symbols for Amarok
 This package provides debugging symbols for all binary packages built from
 amarok source package. It's highly recommended to have this package installed
 before reporting any Amarok crashes to either Amarok developers or Debian
 package maintainers.
