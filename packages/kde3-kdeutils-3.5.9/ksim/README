NOTE: the plugin naming conventions changed
in v0.5 and above, i recommend you to
rm -rf $KDEDIR/lib/libksim* before you install
v0.5 or above, if you are using v0.4 or below.

As of v0.9.0 and above, KSim has the option to
recolour themes to the current KDE color scheme,
if you have any problems of it recolouring to the wrong
color or some other recolouring related problem then
send me the name of the color scheme you are using
and the color values for your background and text color.

Please read BUGS for a list of current known bugs 
and ChangeLog for the changes in the last release.
Also the theme support isn't 100% implemented 
(which it may never be), if you have any theme
related issues then please email me describing what
problem you had and with which theme.

Any other problems? email me (linuxphreak@gmx.co.uk)
