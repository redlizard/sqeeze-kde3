kdeutils (4:3.5.9-2) unstable; urgency=high
                                                                  
  * klatopdaemon does not work with Debian kernels 2.6.25 or newer.
    Those kernels are built without the option: ACPI_PROCFS_POWER which 
       provided the battery and ac interfaces on /proc/acpi/{ac,BAT} on 
       what klaptopdaemon uses. Since the ACPI_PROCFS_POWER is not going to
       be renabled by the kernel team, klaptopdaemon is no longer usable   
       in Debian.                                                          
       So now, klaptopdaemon is now a transitional package that installs   
       kpowersave a nice replacement that does not have this problem.      
       The Depends on klaptopdaemon | kpowersave have been removed from the
       metapackage and a Recommends on kpowersave have been added instead.
