.SH DESCRIPTION
KDE Archiving tool
Ark is a graphical program for managing various archive formats within the
KDE environment. Archives can be viewed, extracted, created and modified
from within Ark.
The program can handle various formats such as tar, gzip, bzip2, zip, rar and
lha (if the appropriate command-line programs are installed).
Ark can work closely with Konqueror in the KDE environment to handle archives,
if you install the Konqueror Integration plugin available in the konq-plugins
package.
