.SH NAME
kcharselect \- KDE Character Selector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kcharselect
[\fIQt-options\fR] [\fIKDE-options\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B KCharSelect
KDE Application.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
Using
.B KCharSelect
one can view all the glyphs, organized by character table, available from any
installed font.  One can also assemble a string of characters by clicking on
characters in the table.  The string can be exported to the clipboard for
later use.
.PP
.B KCharSelect
is helpful for determining which characters in a font have glyphs as well as
for selecting characters that may be difficult to produce.
.P
This program is part of the official KDE utils module.

.TP
.BI \-\-icon \ icon
Use \fIicon\fP as the application icon. \fIicon\fP is the name of the
icon, which can either be an absolute filename path, or otherwise the
icon is sought for in places according to the normal KDE rules.
.TP
.BI \-\-miniicon \ icon
Use \fIicon\fP as the icon in the titlebar. \fIicon\fP is the filename
of the icon, according to the same rules as for the \-\-icon parameter.
.TP
.BI \-\-config \ filename

.TP
.BI \-\-dcopserver \ server
Set the address of the DCOP server to attach to.

.TP
.BI \-\-style \ style

.TP
.BI \-\-geometry \ geometry
sets the client geometry of the main widget.

which is on the form:
.RS
.IP
[\fIwidth\fBx\fIheight\fR][{\fB+-\fR}\fIxpos\fR{\fB+-\fR}\fIypos\fR]
.P
Where \fIwidth\fR and \fIheight\fR gives the desired minimum width and
height, of the main application window. Both in pixels. A value of 0
specifies the default size. The optional \fIxpos\fR and \fIypos\fR
specifies the x,y-position that which is desired for the application
window. Specifying negative values for x or y implies that the x or y
position is to be measured from the left or bottom screen edge,
instead of as in the normal case, with positive values, from the left
and top edges.
