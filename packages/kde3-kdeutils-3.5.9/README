Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com
to get latest copy of Qt 3.3.x version.  If you have peeked there already,
grab the CVS module qt-copy from anoncvs.kde.org, or a snapshot thereof.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.

Please direct any bug reports to our bug list by visiting

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
