/** @mainpage KDE Utilities
*
* The KDE Utilities SVN module collects together an enormous amount
* of small shoddy utilities of dubious value that fall under the
* 'desk utilities' category and that you would normally get for
* free in a box of cereal. These include:
*
* - kfloppy, a floppy disk formatter
* - superkaramba, a form of eyecandy
*
