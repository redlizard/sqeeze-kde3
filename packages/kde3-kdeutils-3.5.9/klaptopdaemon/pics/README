Notes about laptop daemon's icons:

	lo16-app-klaptopdaemon.png  - is only used for the context menu
		only the 16x16 is actually needed

		in fact with recent changes to the iconloader icons other than
		the 16x16 (really 20x20)  are BAD - please don't create them 

	the 3 icons in the action directory:
		laptop_charge/laptop_concharge/laptop_nobattery

		are 'special' - they are read by the application and
		modified on-the-fly to create a bar-graph of how full
		the battery is - you can't just edit them the way you would
		a normal icon - basically any white pixels will be replaced
		with a proportional number of blue ones from the bottom of
		the icon to the top (so pure white pixels are 'magic' and
		should be treated as the portion of the icon that is the graph)
		you can use slightly off-white or a not-quite-saturated 
		white if you want 'white'

		I'd love some cool new battery icons but please contact me 
		if you need some testing before committing
