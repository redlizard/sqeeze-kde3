This module provides support for the VolumeUp, VolumeDown and Mute Internet
keys found in many laptops and special keyboards.

Please note that in order this module to work, mentioned special keys have to
generate appropriate X key symbols (keysyms), namely XF86AudioLowerVolume,
XF86AudioRaiseVolume, XF86AudioMute. You can use "xev" program to watch events
generated by X server and "xmodmap" program to assign events (keycodes) to
keysyms. Also watch kernel log (dmesg) for unknown scancodes.

If you use CTRL in conjunction with volUp/Down it changes the volume by 1%,
otherwise by 10%.

This module is now configurable (though with no configuration GUI), you can
change which channels (kmix device indexes) to change volume on, you can also
tweak volume changing steps. Channels are represented by numeric indexes
starting from zero, in order to get the right channel, you have to experiment
a little (keep the kmix mixer window open). ;) Examples:

# Change "fast" step to 5% and "slow" step to 2%:
kwriteconfig --file kmilodrc --group "generic monitor" --key volumeStepFast 5
kwriteconfig --file kmilodrc --group "generic monitor" --key volumeStepSlow 2

# Change channel to set volume on to 1 (use -1 to use kmix' master device):
kwriteconfig --file kmilodrc --group "generic monitor" --key volumeDeviceIdx 1

# You can also specify different mute channel (leave it unset or set it to -1
# to use the same channel for muting and changing volume):
kwriteconfig --file kmilodrc --group "generic monitor" --key muteDeviceIdx 2

# KMilo now supports an extra channel, whose volume and mute will be set to
# whatever your primary channel is set to. (leave it unset or set it to -1 to
# disable this functionality):
kwriteconfig --file kmilodrc --group "generic monitor" --key extraDeviceIdx 5

# Use following call to apply these settings without restarting your session:
dcop kded kmilod reconfigure

Have fun.
