This is a kded module that can be extended to support various types of hardware
input devices that exist, such as those on keyboards.

It presently supports:
- Apple PowerBooks
- Sony Vaio Laptops (tested on Vaio PCG-GRX series)
- IBM Thinkpads
- Asus Laptops
- Dell laptops (see delli8k/README for models)

The output device is skinnable, though not extensible by 3rd parties currently.
This will come in the future when the API is finalised.

It also lacks very much functionality.  Any input is appreciated.

Header files are not presently installed in order to avoid committing to an API.
