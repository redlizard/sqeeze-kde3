--- KTorrent 2.2.x (KDE3) and KTorrent 3.x (KDE4) in Debian 5.0 (Lenny) ---

Since there have been two stable KTorrent 3.x (for KDE4) releases by the time
of writing and KTorrent 2.2.x (for KDE3) has not been updated much in the
meantime, I decided to ship both versions in Debian 5.0 (Lenny) choosing
KTorrent 3.x as default. As a result of this decision:

* You can get the old KTorrent 2.2.x release by installing ktorrent2.2 package if
  you don't want to install KDE4 runtime dependencies or new features are not
  important for you.

* Since ktorrent binary package provides KDE4 based release from now on,
  it will pull in KDE4 runtime dependencies. However, it is a newer KTorrent
  upstream release and has more features. It should work fine with KDE3 desktop
  environment.

* You cannot co-install both ktorrent2.2 and ktorrent. They conflict with
  each other and you can have only one of them on the system at the same time.

* KTorrent 3.1 supports migration of torrents from KTorrent 2.2 but not
  vice-versa. Therefore, if you start downloading/uploading torrents with
  KTorrent 3.1, you will probably not be able to resume them with KTorrent 2.2
  if you downgrade.

--- GeoIP and builtin contry flags licensing issues ---

Due to licensing restrictions, the source and binary packages of ktorrent do
not include a GeoIP database. The upstream source has been patched to use
system-wide GeoIP library (available in the libgeoip1 package). That package
provides a free GeoIP Country database that is a bit outdated and not very
accurate but it may still be sufficient for most KTorrent users, because
determination of the peer geographic location is only additional and 
non-crucial KTorrent functionality, implemented for information purposes.

However, if you wish to get more accurate information about peer geographic
location, there is a free to download (but undistributable by Debian) "GeoLite
Country" database and even more accurate paid "GeoIP Country" database
available at the following URL:

http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country

Please consult libgeop1 documentation how to upgrade GeoIP database on your
system once you obtain a proper database file (geoip.dat).

The KTorrent builtin country flag images are also not distributed with this
package due to obscure license. If you would like to see country flags next
to the country names, please install kdebase-data package (that is
recommended by the ktorrent binary package).

The commands used to modify upstream source tarball can be found at debian/rules 
"prune-tarball" target.
