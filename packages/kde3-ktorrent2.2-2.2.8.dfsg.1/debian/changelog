ktorrent (2.2.5.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * New upstream bugfix release.
    - Fixes "Refuses to add downloads to existing group" bug (probably
      upstream SVN commit r762299) (Closes: #460470)
  * Remove unused GeoIP.{c,h} from tarball. Update debian/copyright
    accordingly and add patch 07_ to shut automake up.
  * Add "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" debian/control source section.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.3.0
  * Move Homepage from ktorrent long Description to debian/control source
    section.
  * Add kdebase-runtime-data-common as an alternative for kdebase-data in

    plugin.
  * Add a new patch (10_ru_translation_fix.diff) to swap "Отдано" with

ktorrent (2.2.4.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Modestas Vainius]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #452334):
    - Resolves frequent crashes on some systems (esp. SMP) (hence medium
      urgency).
    - "Set max upload/download rate" via tray icon menu should work correctly
      now.
    - A few additional web gui features.
  * Add a few new patches to make cleverer dpkg-shlibdeps happy (almost):
    - 05_cleanup_am_lib_qt.diff - originally a few other libraries like
      libpng12 etc. were exported in automake LIB_QT variable. Only a few (if
      any) KDE applications use them directly so linking any single binary
      against them is unnecessary. KTorrent is not an exception. This patch
      reduces LIB_QT to contain just the main Qt library. Previous version of the
      variable has been made available under the name LIB_QT_EXT. As a result of
      this patch, KTorrent depencences shrank to the bare minumum solving tons
      of dpkg-shlibdeps warnings too.
    - 06_makefile_am_fixups.diff - various fixes to Makefile.am's all around
      the source code with the intention to resolve warnings reported by
      dpkg-shlibdeps. The only type of warnings left are those regarding
      libm.so.6, which can't be fixed because they come from g++ itself.

    country flag images). Patches 10 and 11 have been developed to make
    impact of this as minimal as possible on the users.
  * Remove LDFLAGS patch. It has been integrated upstream.
  * debian/rules: upstream no longer ships .desktop files in applnk.

    support on 32bit architectures. There are known problems with >4GB files
    on all architectures though (Closes: #402185).
  * Use quilt as a patch management system.
  * New patches:
    - 10_use-system-geoip.diff - adds support for the --enable-system-geoip

    - 11_flagdb-alternative-source.diff - adds support for the
      --disable-builtin-country-flags configure parameter. It allows to skip
      installation of non-free ktorrent builtin country flags. In addition,
      the patch adds support for the "flag database" that lets ktorrent get
      country flag images from more than one filesystem source transparently.
      It also adds additional (and the only for the debian package) source -
      flag images shipped with kdebase.
    - 12_gnu_kfreebsd.diff - fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD. Thanks to Petr Salinger
      (Closes: #401753).
    - Usual build system patches for relibtoolization.
  * Add libgeoip-dev to Build-Depends. Build ktorrent with system GeoIP.
  * Add kdebase-data to Recommends. It is needed as a source of the country
    flag images for the Peer View. If not installed, country flags won't be
    shown.
  * Add debian/ktorrent.install. Prepare for multiple binary packages.
  * Add Ktorrent to Debian menu (Closes: #392893).
  * Now 'clean' target fully cleans the source tree after build
    (Closes: #424476).
  * Fully support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Add manual pages for ktorrent and ktshell.
  * Update README.Debian with new information about GeoIP and country flag
    images and add NEWS about accuracy of the default GeoIP Country database.
