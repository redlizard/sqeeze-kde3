ktorrent2.2 (2.2.7.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since there have been two stable KTorrent 3.x (for KDE4) releases by the
    time of writing and KTorrent 2.2.x (for KDE3) has not been updated much in
    the meantime, I decided to ship both versions in Debian Lenny choosing
    KTorrent 3.x as default. Therefore:
    - you can get the old KTorrent 2.2.x release by installing ktorrent2.2
      package if you don't want to install KDE4 runtime dependencies or new
      features are not important for you;
    - since ktorrent binary package provides KDE4 based release from now on,
      it will pull in KDE4 runtime dependencies. However, it is a newer
      KTorrent upstream release and has more features. It should work fine
      with KDE3 desktop environment;
    - you cannot co-install both ktorrent2.2 and ktorrent. They conflict with
      each other and you can have only one of them on the system at the same
      time.
    - KTorrent 3.1 supports migration of torrents from KTorrent 2.2 but not
      vice-versa. Therefore, if you start downloading/uploading torrents with
      KTorrent 3.1, you will probably not be able to resume them with
      KTorrent 2.2 if you downgrade.

ktorrent (2.1.4.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now KTorrent uses system-wide GeoIP library (libgeoip1) and its default
    GeoIP Country database to determine countries, which BitTorrent peers
    originate from. The default free database provided by libgeoip is a bit
    outdated and not very accurate. If you wish to upgrade the database,
    please read /usr/share/doc/ktorrent/README.Debian and
    /usr/share/doc/libgeoip1/README.Debian.
