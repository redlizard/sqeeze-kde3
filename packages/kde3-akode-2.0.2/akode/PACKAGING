The plugins are designed for being packaged and installed separately of akodelib.

Take especially note of the following:
- Do not install mpeg_decoder if you have software patent concerns
- Do not install src_resampler and mpeg_decoder if you want a pure LGPL
  library since they are both derived of GPL libraries.
- If you wish to install plugins in a non-standard place, you can change the
  AKODE_SEARCHDIR definition in lib/pluginhandler.cpp.
- You SHOULD not install sinks for backends you don't use. Thus jack_sink
  should only be installed when jackd is available, polyp_sink only when
  the polypaudio server is used and alsa_sink only when using a Linux kernel
  with ALSA drivers.
  When using direct aKode playback sinks will be autodetected by loading and
  probing plugins in this order: polyp, jack, alsa, oss
