Description: akode plugin for aRts
 aKode is a new multithreaded audio library that provides aRts with
 plugins to play a variety of formats: Ogg Vorbis, Musepack (MPC),
 FLAC and Speex. aKode also focuses on performance, and so it means a
 big enhancement for users runing aRts in non-realtime mode.
