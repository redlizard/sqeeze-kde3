.SH DESCRIPTION
KEnolaba is a simple board strategy game that is played by two players.
There are red and yellow pieces for each player. Beginning from a
start position where each player has 14 pieces, moves are drawn until
one player has pushed 6 of his opponent's pieces out of the board.

The original program was developed in 1993 for DOS and pure Xlib. For
KDE there was a major rewrite.
