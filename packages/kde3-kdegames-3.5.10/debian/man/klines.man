.TH KLINES 6
.SH NAME
klines \- Color Lines game for KDE
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B klines
.I [Qt-options] [KDE-options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
KLines is a simple game. It is played by one player, so there is only one
winner :-). You play for fun and against the high score. It was inspired
by a well known game - ``Color lines'', written for DOS by Olga Demina,
Igor Demina, Igor Ivkin and Gennady Denisov back in 1992.

The main rules of the game are as simple as possible: you move (using the
mouse) marbles from cell to cell and build lines (horizontal, vertical or
diagonal). When a line contains 5 or more marbles, they are removed and
your score grows. After each turn the computer drops three more marbles.
