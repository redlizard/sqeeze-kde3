.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kbounce
.I [Qt-options] [KDE-options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a clone of the popular Jezzball game originally created by
Microsoft. Jezzball is one of the rare and simple games requiring
skill, timing, and patience in order to be successful.  A ball begins
to bounce off of an area enclosed by four borders (like a square). You
must move your pointer to certain areas within the square. Upon
clicking, a new border is constructed at a relatively quick pace. You
can change the direction of the borders by 90 degrees as
well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a
smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever
touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches
a certian part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.
After 75% of the original space has been blocked off from the moving
ball, you advance one level, and one more ball is added to the mix in
the following level.
