.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kreversi
is a simple one player strategy game played against the computer. The
playing field is an 8 by 8 square board divided into 64 squares. The
game piece used is a colored stone - one side of it is red, the other
blue. If a piece is captured by an opposing player, that piece is
turned to reveal the color of that player. A winner is declared when
one player has more pieces of his own color on the board and if there
are no more possible moves.  <Insert here>
