.SH NAME
knetwalk \- A game for system administrators
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B knetwalk
.I [Qt-options] [KDE-options] [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBKNetwalk\fP presents the player with a rectangular grid containing
a server, several clients, and pieces of wire.  The object of the game
is to rotate these elements until every client is connected to the
server, and no wires are left unconnected.  Optionally, you can try to
get a high score by minimizing the number of rotations needed.

Left clicking on a square rotates it counterclockwise, while right
clicking rotates it clockwise.  Middle clicking on a square marks the
square with a blue background and prevents you from rotating it unless
you middle click again to unmark it; this can be very useful for marking
squares which you know are in the correct orientation.
