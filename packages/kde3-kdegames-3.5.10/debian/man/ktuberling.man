.TH KTUBERLING 6
.SH NAME
ktuberling \- Potato game for kids
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ktuberling
.I [Qt-options] [KDE-options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ktuberling
is a game intended for small children. Of course, it may be suitable
for adults who have remained young at heart.

It is a potato editor. That means you can drag and drop eyes, mouths,
mustache, and other parts of face and goodies onto a potato-like guy.

There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the
funniest faces you can.

There is a museum (like a ``Madame Tusseau'' gallery) where you can
find many funny examples of decorated potatoes. Of course, you can
send your own creations to the programmer, Eric Bischoff
(e.bischoff@noos.fr), who will include them in the museum if he gets
some spare time.
