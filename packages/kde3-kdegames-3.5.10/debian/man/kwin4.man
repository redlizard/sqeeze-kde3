.SH DESCRIPTION
Four wins is a game for two players.  Each player is represented by a
color (yellow and red).  The goal of the game is to get four connected
pieces of your color into a row, column or any diagonal.  This is done
by placing one of your pieces into any of the seven columns.  A piece
will begin to fill a column from the bottom, i.e. it will fall down
until it reaches the ground level or another stone.  After a move is
done it is the turn of the other player. This is repeated until the
game is over, i.e. one of the players has four pieces in a row, column
or diagonal or no more moves are possible because the board is filled.
