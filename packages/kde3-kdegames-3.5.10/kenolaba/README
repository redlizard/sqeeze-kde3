Another kool game for KDE :)

Kenolaba is a game like Abalone. You play against the computer on a
board. For rules look at the HTML manual.

INSTALLATION:
If you find this directory (and README) in a kde package bundled with
other applications, there is nothing to do. By installing the package
Kenolaba should be installed too.

Otherwise get the kdeapps package and unpack it.
Make the kenolaba/ directory (with this README) a subdirectory of
kdeapps/ and add "kenolaba" to the SUBDIRS variable in the toplevel
Makefile.in of the kdeapps package. By installing the package kdeapps now
Kenolaba should be installed too.

Have fun...
...and remember: Your computer already is a real thinking machine !
