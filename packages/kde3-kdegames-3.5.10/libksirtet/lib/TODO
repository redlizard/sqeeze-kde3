* change to an event-driven data exchange framework (it currently uses a timer
  on the server side) -> we probably need a way to ensure clients are not
  dead (?)

* grid/row layout of boards
* better dialogs ...
* check the 64bit fix in "types.h"

* user help (add help button to wizard)
* tooltips !!
* API documentation

* heavy test of network game
* test option widget in netmeeting (--> needs fixing in NetMeeting class)
* test of options for players and computers

* keys configuration : probably need to change KKeyDialog (the msgbox for
  duplicate keys is so annoying ...) + unused key finder
