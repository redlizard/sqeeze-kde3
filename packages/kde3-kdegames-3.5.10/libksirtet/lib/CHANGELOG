0.1.8 (11 April 2001)
  * better Player/Meeting "choose boxes"
  * use KExtendedSocket (get rid of custom utilities)
    and hopefully fix network game

0.1.7
  * resize handle removed from statusbar of netmeeting dialog

0.1.6
  * fixed a bug in key configuration
  * players name access improved
  * some internal cleanups + use of KDialogBase

0.1.5
  * many bug fixes for network game
  * added a framework for simple multiplayers games
  * Wizard-like configuration
  * enhanced keys configuration

0.1.4
  * all data transport is now done via QDataStream (no more bitorder/storage
    problems).
  * QDataStream use make things easier from the user point of view (at least
    I think so).
  * big cleaning : the library restricts itself to data transport between
    boards and to game configuration. The library doesn't want to and doesn't
	have to manage things like game pause or gameover of a specific player ...
	all those things must be done by the game programmer.

0.1.3
  * ported to QT 2.0 (hard way : now we send QString over the network :)

0.1.2
  * finally THE bug has been found (eight months later) !
	so network game seems stable.
  * lots of bug fixes

0.1.1
  * first code (June 1998 : pause in dvplt)
