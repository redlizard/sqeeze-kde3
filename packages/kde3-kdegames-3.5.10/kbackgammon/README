This file describes KBackgammon
-------------------------------


KBackgammon is a backgammon program for KDE2. It is based on the code,
ideas and concepts of KFibs (which is a FIBS client for KDE1). For a
short time, KBackgammon was called bacKgammon (if you know somebody
who is still using bacKgammon, please force them to upgrade :-)).


KBackgammon is a backgammon program built around a graphical backgammon
board. Since it uses moular backgammon engines, it can easily be extended
beyond the current set of engines. At the moment, the following types of
backgammon games are supported:

	FIBS    - online games on the First Internet Backgammon Server.
                  the computer handles the network connection and 
                  translates the textual messages from the server into
                  graphical representations. this engine offers separate
                  chat window and player list window to simplify the 
                  interaction with the server

	Offline - play against yourself or a freind that is sitting next
                  to you. the most important role of the computer is rolling 
                  the dice.

In the near to mid future, the program will be extended with the following 
two kinds of engines:

	GNUBg   - the GNU backgammon program is a powerful neural network 
                  and KBackgammon will soon allow you to play against it 
                  from the convinience of your KDE desktop.

        NextGen - this extension of the offline engine will allow you to play
                  against other players on the network. the computer makes
                  sure that the dice are fair and it handles the netwok 
                  communication.

If you lust for other kinds of engines (besides FIBS, there are other 
internet servers out there and it somebody might want to have access
to these as well), please contact the Jens Hoefkens <jens@hoefkens.com>
and make your wishes heard.
