The backs for these cards came from the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.  The original images can be found at:
http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html
along with a lot more just like 'em.

The penguins are by "The PAPA" <papalini@biancaneve.ing.unifi.it>
and can be found at:

and there's a lot more of those too.
