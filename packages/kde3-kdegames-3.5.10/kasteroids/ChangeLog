Version 2.2
 * [Martin Jones]      Show "Game Over" and stats in the game window instead
                       of displaying many annoying dialogs at the end of the
		       game.

Version 2.1
 * [Martin Jones]
                       Shooting uses energy too.
		       Added firepower powerup.
		       Adjusted speed of asteroids to make game playable again.

Version 1.90
  * [Martin Jones]     KDE 2.0 and QCanvas port
                       Introduce ship's energy supply.  Thrusting, shields,
                       etc. use power, and when you run out you're basically
                       screwed.  Fortunately some asteroids release fuel
                       when you destroy them.
                       Make brakes, etc. permanent features once you catch them.
                       Made ship much cooler.

  * [Kristof <krzygod@kki.net.pl>]
                       Add brakes, shield, teleport, configureable keys,

                       Also the cool shield graphics.
