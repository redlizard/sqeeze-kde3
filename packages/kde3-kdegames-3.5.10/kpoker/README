This is version 0.8 (nearly) of KPoker a not that simple poker clone
for the K Desktop Environment <http://www.kde.org>.

This version is considered to be pretty stable. Please take a look at
the file ChangeLog to see what was changed recently.

Have fun with the game and report any problems / bugs suggestions.
