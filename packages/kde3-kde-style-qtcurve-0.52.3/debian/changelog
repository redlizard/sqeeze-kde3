    called 'Clean'.

  * Improve look of small V arrows.
  * Even duller dull glass, but much more useable.

    field - more Gtk like.

    gtkScrollViews set to 'true' to have the scrollbars drawn outside of
    scrollviews. (However, doesn't look very good)
  * Lighten combo list frame.
  * Dont round MDI buttons.
  * Fix opera's MDI buttons within menubars.
  * Always assume PE_ButtonBevel is enabled - used for QtConfig's colour

 -- Bastian Venthur <venthur@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Jun 2007 11:21:00 +0200

kde-style-qtcurve (0.51-1)  unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #427043)

  * Changed shading to use HSL colour space. This can be altered by editing
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qtcurvestylerc and setting 'shading=simple' for the
    previous method, or 'shading=hsv' to use HSV.
  * Add options:
      Border all of menu/toolbars.
      Darker borders.
      'V' arrows.
  * Fix raised listview headers.
  * Fix glass style menuitem appearance.
  * Modifed look of dullglass, looks "softer"
  * Improve look of plastik mouse-over for non coloured scrollbars.
  * For disabled buttons, use standard fill but lighten border.
  * Use darker colours for mouse-over and default button - helps with light
    colour schemes.
  * Dont draw sunken panel around checked menuitems.
  * Fix karm (and others?) statusbar icon.
  * Fix for radio buttons in apps where
    QApplication::NormalColor!=QApplication::colorSpec() (e.g. designer)
