.SH SYNOPSIS

[ \fIxml-data-file\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBKugar\fP is a tool for generating business quality reports that can
be viewed and printed.  It includes a standalone report viewer and a
KPart report viewer.  The latter means that any KDE application can
embed the report viewing functionality and that reports can be viewed
using the Konqueror browser.
.PP
Kugar will create a report for the data stored in the data file
\fIxml-data-file\fP.  Data files typically end in \fB.kud\fP.
Note that simply clicking on a data file in Konqueror will cause Kugar
to create a report.
.PP
The data will be displayed according to the layout described in a template
file.  This template file is generally named in the data file.
Template files typically end in \fB.kut\fP.  See
.BR kudesigner (1)
for a tool for creating template files.
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Office Suite.
.SH OPTIONS
Below are the kugar-specific options.
For a full summary of options, run \fIkugar \-\-help\fP.

Full user documentation is available through the KDE Help Centre.
You can also enter the URL
\fIhelp:/kugar/\fP
directly into konqueror or you can run

from the command-line.
