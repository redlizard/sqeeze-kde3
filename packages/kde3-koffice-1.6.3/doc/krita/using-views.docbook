<title>Views</title>

<para>
One of the most important things you need to know when working with a painting
or image editing application, is how to adapt the view of your image to your
(changing) needs. This chapter describes the various possibilities &krita;
offers.

<title>Zooming</title>

<para>
By zooming, you can view your images at various levels of detail.  Zooming out
will show a larger part of the image, but with less detail.  &krita; offers a
couple of options that affect which part of the image is shown:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry><term>Zooming in</term>
<listitem><para>Zooming in allows you to see more details, but you will only
see a smaller part of the image. You can zoom in by choosing the
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Zoom
in</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item, by clicking the
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
fileref="toolbars-button-zoomin.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject></inlinemediaobject> <guilabel>Zoom in</guilabel> button on the
toolbar, or by pressing the <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>+</keycap></keycombo> keys.
You can zoom in up to 1600% (a 16:1 ratio) via a number of fixed zoom levels.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Zooming out</term>
<listitem><para>Zooming out allows you to see a larger part of the image while
losing some detail. Zooming out can be done by choosing the
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Zoom
out</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item, by clicking the
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
fileref="toolbars-button-zoomout.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject></inlinemediaobject> <guilabel>Zoom out</guilabel> button on the
toolbar, or by pressing the <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>-</keycap></keycombo> keys.
You can zoom out up to 0.2% (a 1:500 ratio) via a number of fixed zoom levels.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Going back to 100%</term>
<listitem><para>As viewing your image at its real size is quite handy at
times, you can do so via the
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Actual
pixels</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item or by pressing <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>0</keycap></keycombo>.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Zooming in and out from the <guilabel>Overview</guilabel>
tab</term>
<listitem><para>The <guilabel>Overview</guilabel> tab of the control box
(usually found at the right hand side of the &krita; window) also allows you
to change the zoom level by using the slider or the spinbox. Slightly
different zoom levels are available here, so if zooming in or out as described
above does not produce a view you want, you can try using this option. The
<guibutton>1:1</guibutton> button offers another way of getting back to a 100%
zoom.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Special zooms</term>
<listitem><para>There are two more special ways of zooming. The
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Fit to
Page</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item zooms your image such that it is
as large as possible while remaining entirely visible. The
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Full Screen
Mode</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item (pressing <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;&Shift;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> will also activate
this mode) enlarges the &krita; window to fill your entire screen, removing
the title bar as well. Although this is not a <quote>real</quote> way of
zooming, it can help you by showing just that little bit more of your
image.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="views-views">
<title>Working with views</title>

<para>
Apart from changing the zoom level of your view, you can also open different
views for the same image. This way, you can for example look at two different
parts of your image that would not fit on your screen together otherwise.
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry><term>New view windows</term>
<listitem><para>You can open a new &krita; window for your image by choosing
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>New
View</guimenuitem></menuchoice> Both windows are independent from each other
(so you can select different tools, view different parts of your image,
&etc;), but changes you make to the image in one window are immediately
visible in the other. To close a window, use the normal window closing button.
There is also an option <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Close
All Views</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, which closes all newly created views and
leaves only the original window open.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Splitting views</term>
<listitem><para>You can also split a window into two views. Like a new window,
one view of a split window has its own settings for brushes, zoom levels and
the like, but both views are shown in the same window. To split your window,
choose <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Split
View</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The viewing area of the &krita; window will
then be divided into two halves. You can switch between horizontal and
vertical division with the
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guisubmenu>Splitter
Orientation</guisubmenu></menuchoice> menu, and get back to one view by
choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Remove
View</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para></listitem>

<title>Miscellaneous view options</title>

<para>
&krita; also offers two options that can help you with knowing where you are.
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry><term>Rulers</term>
<listitem><para>You can have &krita; show rulers along the sides of your
image, indicating x and y coordinates. To do so, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
Rulers</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>R</keycap></keycombo>. The rulers will
automatically adapt to your zoom level to show a proper amount of
subdivisions. To remove the rulers, choose the same menu option (now called
<guimenuitem>Hide Rulers</guimenuitem>) or press <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>R</keycap></keycombo> again. </para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Grid</term>
<listitem><para>In order to see grid lines, choose
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show
Grid</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You can set the distance between grid lines
with <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guisubmenu>Grid
Spacing</guisubmenu></menuchoice> and you can choose different colours for the
lines in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&krita;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog (see <link
linkend="settings-preferences-grid">the Grid section of the Settings
chapter</link>).
