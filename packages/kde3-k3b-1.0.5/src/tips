<p>...that you do not need to erase a CDRW before rewriting it manually
since K3b can do that automatically before writing.</p>

<p>...that you do not need to bother with any settings if you do not know
what they mean. K3b is able to choose the settings best suited for you.</p>

<tip category="K3b">
<html>
<p>...that K3b has two types of settings. On the one hand K3b has settings like most
KDE applications have accessable through the configuration dialog via the settings menu;
on the other hand every K3b action dialog has three buttons to load and save defaults
for that action.  This way one may, for example, set the defaults for CD Copy: these defaults
will then be loaded every time the CD Copy dialog is opened. The button <em>K3b defaults</em>
will restore the <em>factory settings</em> in case you do not know if the settings you chose
are appropriate.</p>

<html>
<p>...that you do not need to bother changing the settings marked as <em>advanced</em> if you 
do not know what they mean. K3b's defaults are suitable for most daily use.</p>

<tip category="K3b">
<html>
<p>Just left-click one of your devices in the device and file tree and see what happens. K3b opens a specific
window based on the media's contents. For an audio CD for example you will be given a list of the tracks with
the possibility to rip these tracks to any format supported by K3b (like mp3 or Ogg-Vorbis).</p>

<tip category="K3b">
<html>
<p>...that K3b lets you choose media instead of devices for burning. So if you want to burn to a certain
medium simply insert it and wait for K3b to detect it. It will then appear as your burning medium.</p>
