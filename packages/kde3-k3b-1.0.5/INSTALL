Installing K3b 1.0
------------------


What you need to run K3b:
 mandatory:
  - since K3b is a CD writing program a cd writer would be a good thing to have ;-)
  - the QT3 library (at least version 3.2)
  - the KDE3 libraries (at least version 3.2)
  - the cdparanoia library for cd ripping from Monty
  - the cdrtools (cdrecord, mkisofs) from Joerg Schilling
  - the dvd+rw-tools by Andy Polyakov for DVD writing

 optional:
  - cdrdao, the other linux cd writing program from Andreas Mueller
  - the transcode tools for DVD ripping and DivX/XviD encoding from Thomas Oestreich
  - vcdimager >= 0.7 for creating video cds
  - libmad for mp3 decoding
  - ogg-vorbis libraries for encoding and decoding
  - the FLAC++ libraries for flac-decoding
  - the eMovix package
  - TagLib by Scott Wheeler for reading Meta data tags
  - the musepack (or now mpcdec) library for decoding Musepack audio files
  - the ffmpeg library to decode other audio file formats such as wma
  - the sndfile library to decode audio file formats such as AIFF or VOC
  - the lame library to encode audio files in the mp3 format
  - sox to encode audio files in formats such as AIFF or VOC
  - a dynamically compiled libffmpeg for wma decoding
  - the musicbrainz library for metadata queries for single audio titles

After that it's all the same:

  ./configure

or try ./configure --help to learn about the options.

If configure was successful you are presented with a list of configure results that shows
which optional features are enabled. Now just compile K3b:

  make

Now you are ready to install:

  make install (as root)


See PERMISSIONS on hints how to properly setup the permissions to use K3b without problems.


Have fun
