1.0.5
=====
 * Fix CD Copy device selection (Bug 151924)
 * Fixed HAL mounting (thanks to Ken Milmore)
 * Always wait for the drive to become ready before starting verification.

1.0.4
=====
 * Never use growisofs parameter -dvd-compat with DVD-RW media in restricted overwrite mode
 * Unmount medium before DVD formatting
 * Silently (without introducing new strings for translation) allow the burning of files
   bigger than 4 GB with appropriate versions of genisoimage or mkisofs.
 * Do only reload the medium before verification if necessary, i.e. if the newly written
   track cannot be read otherwise (many old drives depend on this). Hopefully this will
   at least work around the aweful "DMA disabled" bug for many users.
	
1.0.3
=====
 * Reverted to old behaviour of reloading medium before verification. Not enough
   testing had been done before introducing this and some systems fail to read the
   medium before reload (Bugs 147297, 147328, 147420, 147698).
 * Do not crash when the currently playing audio project item is removed (Bug 147548).
 * Added desktop actions to handle empty media with K3b.
 * Fixed read retry when reading data tracks (Bug 147778)
 * K3b's dialogs now honor the global button layout setting (Bug 147799)
 * Do not crash on mp3 files without tags if compiled with taglib support (Bug 142651)
 * Do not allow to copy a rewritable media to itself.
 * Fixed crash on startup with devices that return bogus GET PERFORMANCE data (Bug 147676)

1.0.2
=====
 * Properly determine the capacity of complete CD-R(W) media.
 * Mark a data project as modified if files are renamed.
 * Allow adding of all actions to the welcome window (Bug 145866)
 * Added "NoDisplay=true" property to k3b-cue.desktop and k3b-iso.desktop 
 * Fixed supported write speed detection on some devices
 * No reload before verification and between writing sessions (CD copy + Mixed Mode CD) anymore

1.0.1
=====
 * Fixed crash when using the Device menu without a selected device.
 * Fixed DVD copy when reading from a DVD+RW.
 * Fixed --without-alsa configure check
 * Fixed a crash in Video DVD ripping when the title does not contain an audio stream
 * Only use the mkisofs parameters -biblio, -copyright, and -abstract if they have been set. Using them
   with invalid values (empty) seems to result in broken iso images sometimes.
 * Better compatibility with recent transcode development branch
 * Fixed Multisession import size handling.
 * Fixed Lame quality preset handling.
 * Made libk3bdevice really thread-safe. This fixes the disabled DMA bug!
 * New configure check --without-cdrecord-suid-root to disable K3b's check for cdrecord permissions.
   Although not recommended it is requested by many distributors.
 * Changed the order of the buttons in the tool dialogs to match the KDE order.
 * Added handling of the newly introduced genisoimage parameter -allow-limited-size
 * Make the K3b Sox audio encoder plugin work with newer sox versions (Thanks, Stephan.)

1.0
===
 * K3b now includes a VideoDVD kio slave. It can be used in Konqueror through the protocol videodvd:/
   to copy the files from a VideoDVD with on-the-fly decryption if libdvdcss is installed.
   (Be aware that in some countries it is not permitted to use libdvdcss.)
 * New Device menu containing all the actions possible for a device (like eject, unmount, ...).
   This includes the possibility of assigning shortcuts to these kind of actions.
 * K3b now warns if user parameters for external programs have been specified. This has been introduced
   because there were some bug report that were caused by faulty user parameters.
 * Cleaned up all the job classes: No job creates a widget anymore. This allows for non-GUI usage of libk3b.
   For example in a kioslave.
 * New option in the data project to not cache the inodes. That means it is possible to have multiple
   actual copies of the same file on one CD/DVD.
 * K3b now tries to disable stuff that might influence the burning process. This includes the KDED module
   mediamanager, SuSEPlugger, and automounting (currently supported: subfs, supermount).
 * New Audio Track source editor dialog to cut audio track sources at the beginning and the end.
 * Splitted "read retries" and "ignore read errors" for data and audio sectors in cd copy and set new
   defaults for audio sectors which make more sense: 5 retires and skip unreadable sectors.
 * New Mediamanager which makes K3b always know which device contains which medium. This makes medium handling 
   more smooth and the user now selects a medium instead of a device.
   Other advantages:
    - No waiting time anymore when asking for information on media (including for example Audio CD ripping).
    - Nice default image filenames.
    - CD Copy: Enable/disable options based on the source medium
    - Automatically select newly inserted media as burning medium
 * DCOP call directBurn() now returns a boolean value stating if the process could be started.
 * New DCOP calls cddaRip(), videocdrip(), and videodvdrip() with media:/ url support.
 * K3b can now handle media:/ urls from the command line to specify devices
 * Better Lame settings dialog. Easier to use for the novice user and better defaults.
 * Nicer Ogg Vorbis encoder settings dialog.
 * K3b now shows the DVD Medium ID in the disk information view.
 * K3b now displays a rough estimate on the remaining time for the current job.
 * New automatic media size mode for the projects. This means K3b uses the size from an inserted medium
   for the project maximum size.
 * Make a suggestion for the filename when saving a project based on the Volume ID (data projects) or the
   CD-Text title (Audio CD)
 * The Audio encoder plugins are now able to provide (very simplistic) user feedback in case of an error.
 * New settings "Swap byte order" and "Write Wave header" in the audio encoding plugin using external apps.
   This makes way for the usage of such programs as mppenc to encode Musepack files. In fact, mppenc is set up
   as a default along with flac if installed.
 * New DCOP interface: K3bJobInterface which provides DCOP signals for the currently running job. It may,
   for example, be used to provide information to a Karamba module.
 * New KFile plugin for K3b projects. For now it only shows the type of the project (Data DVD or Audio CD or ...)
   but may be extended to show arbitrary information.
 * K3b now chooses default image names based on the project name or the volumeid/cdtext title in case of
   CD/DVD copy.
 * The K3b Project DCOP Interface now uses the QString type for url parameters instead of KURL.
 * Save/load audio cd track sources in audio projects
 * Display a beautified volume id. For example: THE_TRANSPORTER -> The Transporter
 * Check if the image directory exists before starting to create a project image
 * Possibility to hide the OSD temporarily for one process.
 * Completely rewritten Video DVD ripping and transcoding support:
   - Simple on-the-fly transcoding of Video DVD titles
   - Interface similar to Audio CD ripping
   - Preview images in the ripping window
   - Automatic clipping
   - Simple resizing with automatic aspect ratio handling
 * File System presets for all data projects including all the advanced options.
 * Completely rewritten data project verification
   - K3b now compares the written image instead of the single files
   - Verification of Video DVD projects
 * Little GUI changes:
   - Changed the dialog layout in the action dialogs.
   - Simplified the layout of the burn dialogs for data projects (more advanced settings hidden)
   - Improved theme support (transparent themes)
 * Device buffer status display for DVD burning with growisofs >= 7.0
 * Support for Audio CD ripping with libcdio instead of libcdparanoia
 * Support for Cdrkit, the Debian fork of cdrtools

0.12.7
======
 * Fixed crash when refreshing the device list.
 * Fixed cancellation of adding files to a data project.
 * Fixed on-the-fly data project burning.

 * Fixed --cdimage and --dvdimage parameters.
 * Fixed the file browser menu. Now it contains the bookmarks and "add to project" actions again.
 * Fixed Index 0 (Pregap) handling in audio cue files.
 * Improved handling of broken cue files: K3b now searches the directory for image files that could fit

Do not report success even if audio project conversion failed.

0.12
Added "Mpeg Still" support to Video-CD Project
FreeBSD support (thanks to Adriaan De Groot)
Support for all global CD-Text fields with cdrecord.
Some GUI changes: cleaned up the action dialogs, moved the burnfree option to the global settings dialog
	since turning it off should be a very seldomly used task.
Added support for multiple copies to the projects.
Added missed VCD 3.0 track interpretation option for SVCD's
New Lame encoding plugin providing a proper configuration dialog.
Added Bookmarks to the file browser.
Fixed window layering problem with windowmanagers != kwm
Added KPart plugin which converts a list of audio files into one of the supported encoder formats.
Allow disabling of CD-Text reading in cd-copy to overcome problems with CD-Text on some drives.
Check CD-Text crc when copying
Fixed incorrect PBC order, PBC now should work on all "standalone" DVD Players
Fixed waittime bug for PBC infinite timeout.
Import Audio Cue files into an audio project.
It is now possible to open an iso image or an audio cue file just like a project file.
Create cue files for an audio CD ripped into one single file
Show writer buffer state in addition to fifo buffer when writing CDs.
Show device buffer state for DVD writing (does not work always yet)
Fixed read and save setting in VideoCD project.
Big parts of the audio project have been rewritten to have a way better design:
	- K3b now does not create additional silence between the tracks by default
          the pregap is treated as part of the previous track like in all other
          writing applications.
        - Instead it's possible to add additional silence manually to a track.
        - Allow multible sources for one track.
        - Split tracks, merge tracks.
        - Improved track dialog.
K3b now always writes a logfile in $(KDEHOME)/share/apps/k3b/lastlog.log
New device configuration format which solves all issues with removable devices like USB.
Copy CSS encrypted DVDs if libdvdcss is installed.
Libsndfile decoder plugin. This includes support for AIFF audio files.

Added option to load the last used settings in addition to the default user settings in every
	action dialog.
Show system device name in case the string representing two devices are equal.
Fixed the docking issues. No floating dock windows anymore. :) I have no idea why I wasn't able to do this 
	before... it was so easy after all.
Plugin based Audio Output system for Audio project "preview".
Dropped id3lib in favor of TagLib (great work Scott :)
When the speed for an on-the-fly audio project is set to "Auto" K3b now determines the max writing speed.
Do not close dialogs after the action is done (for example cd copy)
Directly copy Audio tracks from an Audio CD to an Audio project.
Session management
Made K3b a unique application only allowing one instance.
Improved dcop interface for data projects which allows to add and remove items 
	to and from specific folders in the project.
Conditional audio ripping pattern. Now what does that mean? It means that you can do stuff like:
	"if the track has a genre encoded use it, otherwise use 'misc'" and stuff like that.
New project plugin interface. Example: the audio project cddb plugin is now a project plugin
MusicBrainz support (Query audio file tags over the internet)
K3b now has a "smart" automatic multisession handling in Data projects.
Replaced the system tray by an OSD inspired by the one in amaroK
Better symlink handling with proper size information if "follow symlinks" is activated.
HAL support (turn on your USB writer while K3b is running and see it getting detected automatically)
eMovix 0.9.0 support
	
0.11.10
Support Mp3 files starting with multiple ID3 tags.
Improved ~ handling in the QuickDirSelector.
Save/Load composer fields in audio projects
Save/Load default DVD Copy reading device
	
0.11.9
Fixed data project size calculation (for good this time).
	
0.11.8
K3b now searches for the Debian cdrecord wrapper script and properly selects the cdrecord version to use
	(cdrecord.mmap or cdrecord.shm) based on the kernel version. This should fix all problems with
	K3bSetup on Debian.
Fixed writing speed parsing with patched cdrecord
Add leading zero to tracknumber meta data field when encoding audio tracks.
Fixed data project size calculation if files from different devices have the same inode number.
It is now possible to enter hexadecimal values in the boot image load segment fields.
Fixed external program encoder plugin (this includes lame and flac encoding)

0.11.7
Check size of returned CD-TEXT data to be a multiple of the pack length. This should fix problems
	with CD copy.
Audio Project: Do not overwrite CD-Text values loaded from the project file with the ones detected.
Added --copydvd command line parameter
Do only read MCN and ISRCs when copying an audio cd since scanning them takes a very long time.
Fixed cdrdao 1.1.8 version handling (no ATAPI warning)
Fixed crash when using the Audiometadatarenamer on Movix Projects
Automatically enable UDF extensions in case the project contains files bigger then 2 gb.

0.11.6
Fixed length calculation for long FLAC files.

Again fixed some disk detection problems which were introduced with the previous fixes :-(
Fixed a crash which occured if the last boot image was displayed in the fileview while removing it.
Support for ID3 Tags in FLAC files.
Support for cdrdao 1.1.8.
	
0.11.4
Fixed adding of hidden files (wrong naming of config entries)
Use a default imagefile name for cloning if none was specified.
Use the Joliet names if no Rockridge is available in session import
	
0.11.3
fixed features detection with some devices.
fixed multisession writing on some systems (K3b used to open the device instead of leaving it to mkisofs to
	prevent permission problems. Sadly this does not work with all systems since it seems that K3b does
	not close the device early enough so cdrecord cannot open it.)

0.11.2
K3bProcess now has a clean API and a non-stupid implementation which fixes the kde 3.2 issue
way better than the hotfix from 0.11.1.
Fixed a crash at K3b start which happened with ROM drives that return zero length modepage 0x05 data.
fixed onthefly DVD copy issues
K3b now uses the internal reader for DVD copy instead of readcd
added read retries and "ignore read error" options to the dvd copy dialog
fixed handling of empty raw toc data
fixed the bug that made K3b try to use cdrdao for DVD iso image writing.
add files to a project by dropping them on the corresponding tab
removed the "query cddb" option from the copy dialog since this is configured globally anyway.
fixed loading of VideoDVD projects
Fixed VideoDVD project with a HACK. mkisofs is not able to create a VideoDVD using graft-points which
	is the default in K3b. So now K3b links all VIDEO_TS files in a temp directory.
	
0.11.1
fixed an issue introduced with KDE 3.2rc1 which caused on-the-fly data writing to fail all the time.
  (If you need to know: For some reason KProcess makes the Stdin fd O_NONBLOCK. This way mkisofs is
   not  able to write properly to cdrecord's stdin anymore.)

0.11
fixed libcdparanoia-loading on Debian (and maybe some other systems)
fixed crash at end of image creation in DVD project
fixed filesize display for very large files and projects (integer overflow)
fixed CD-TEXT reading. On some systems some senseless characters where appended.
fixed Id3lib detection in configure.in.in
added primitive supermount support
kernel 2.5 compile fixes (thanks to ismail (cartman) d�mez <ismail.donmez@boun.edu.tr>)
K3b now defaults to the generic-mmc cdrdao driver if the used burner is not listed in 
	cdrdao's driver table. As all modern drives use the generic-mmc driver anyway this
	is valid and prevents from a lot of newbie problems.
Added a thememanager and the new crystal look by Everaldo
K3b does not mount the disk for session import or data verification anymore. This way supermount
	users will have no problems.
merged cue/bin and isoimage burning in one dialog which provides image-type-detection
	supported so far: iso, cue, cdrdao toc, cdrecord clone images
better systemconfigcheck messages when cdrecord is not running with root privs
proper automatic writing mode and writing app selection for non-DAO-capable writers
overwriting of files in a new session
default CD size is now 80 min
generic resampling for all audio plugins
support for mono files
support for 8Bit wave files
FLAC decoding plugin (thanks to John Steele Scott)
check if a DVD-R(W) writer supports incremental streaming before trying multisession
check if a DVD-R(W) writer supports testwriting before trying a simulation
fixed DVD-Copy. We needed to determine the size of the data to copy for ourselves instead of relying
	on the kernel
Automatic CD-writing speed selection (chooses always the max for now)
Technical info about audiofiles in the audio project are displayed in the track properties dialog
One may now add complete dirs to an audio project
Detection of Justlink support
Finally the device handling is completely independant. No calls to cdrecord anymore. That's why we
now have a libk3bdevice.
Improved writing speed estimation for audio tracks.
Added a button which determines the supported writing speeds with the mounted media. this way it is possible
	to also select dvd writing speeds other than 1x
fixed directory sorting in iso filesystems
fixed boot image file sorting
Joliet long support (103 chars joliet filenames)
improved meta tag handling for audio encoding, support for album title and stuff
fixed crash when only creating images without an installed cd writer
writing speed is loaded correctly again
Completely rewritten CD copy:
   - Copy Audio, multisession and Mixed mode CDs.
   - Copy CD-TEXT
   - Create CD-TEXT from Cddb entries
   - Audio reading with cdparanoia for high quality ripping
   - no cdrdao anymore
Support for new growisofs option to specify the size of a written image in DAO mode
Added check for free space in temp dir to dvd copy
Added a script to simplify the start of K3bSetup2.
	
0.10
DVD writing support with the DVD+RW-tools by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
DVD formatting
DVD Copy (pure data dvd copy without any video transcoding)
CD Cloning with cdrtools >= 2.01a17
device capabilities detection without cdrecord. This solves the long startup problem with ATAPI devices.
moved audio ripping pattern configuration from options dialog to audio ripping dialog
option to automatically erase CD-RWs and DVD-RWs without asking before writing
dragging files from a data project to the audio player (basically it's just a KURLDrag so it may be dragged
	everywhere)
K3b is now divided in three libs and the main application: libk3bcore, libk3btools, and libk3bproject
	this makes creating KParts-plugins easy. Two examples can be found in the tests/kpartplugins dir
	one of them is a former K3b option which allowed to use audio meta data to rename files while
	adding them to a data project. Now this is done by a plugin and a much higher degree of user 
	interaction.
Iso9660 file sorting (mkisofs -sort)
libid3 support for better mp3 tag access (we had that in some very old version but back then
	K3b depended on it. Now it defaults to using KFileMetaInfo if it's not available)
Pluggable audio decoding
Pluggable audio encoding and completely rewritten audio ripping
	much faster now due to a much better threading
Check for read permission when adding files to a project
file filter in binimagewritingdialog and isoimagewritingdialog (thanx to David Maciejak)
Verification of written data (compares md5 sums of all written files).
K3bSetup is not longer compiled unless explicit activated (K3bSetup is outdated and K3bSetup2 is still not ready)
K3b now also compiles without aRts. In this case the audioplayer will be useless (but still there)
no need for special mkisofs permissons anymore. K3b now openes the device itself when importing
	an old session.
added a little color animation when dropping files onto a directory in data projects
	it is always hard to tell if one dropped on the correct dir. If some one has a better animation 
	I would be interested in replacing this simple one.
Added CD-TEXT reading (used for Audio CD ripping)
sox encoder plugin to encode to all audio formats supported by sox (will anyone ever use this??)
encoder plugin that let's you specify a commandline to encode the data. Typical example would be calling lame to
	encode to mp3.
much better TOC reading. K3b now displays multisession info.
m3u Playlist creation for ripped audio files
replaced the old K3bSetup with a quite simple KControl Module which is only able to change the
	needed permission for devices and external programs. Everything else is nowadays done
	by the distros.

  merged cdrdaoparser and cdrdaowriter
added multisession cd copy
fixed onlyCreateImage (this time for real!)
