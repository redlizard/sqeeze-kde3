This is the 0.2 release of libisofs. For changes, see the ChangeLog.

Libisofs implements the reading of the famous ISO-9660 (ECMA-167) file system, 
found on CD-ROM media. It also supports the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and
Microsoft Joliet extensions. It allows user-mode programs to query the
filesystem volume descriptors and traverse through the directory structure.
Preliminary support for El-Torito boot CDs are added in version 0.2.

To use it in your project, I recommend to copy bswap.h, isofs.h, iso_fs.h, 
el_torito.h rock.h and isofs.c to your sources, and include isofs.h in the 
appropriate places.

Currently only the directory tables are parsed, the path tables are not.
(The path tables contain redundant information.)

Also a sample program can be compiled with the supplied Makefile. Simply
execute 'make', it should create the executable file isofs.

On big-endian systems, you need to define WORDS_BIGENDIAN (either in the
compiler command-line, or if you defined HAVE_CONFIG_H, in config.h)
