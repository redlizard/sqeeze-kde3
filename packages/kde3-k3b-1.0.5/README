K3b Version 1.0

Thanx for downloading K3b - The CD Kreator

These are the features so far:
 - the most userfriendly interface ever ;-)
   - themable

 - Media-centric user interface:
   - Select the medium to use for burning instead of the device
   - K3b always knows about all optical devices and inserted media and adjusts the UI accordingly

 - writing audio-cds
   - On-the-fly decoding of many audio formats through plugin struxture
     (decoding plugins for mp3, ogg vorbis, flac, wave, musepack, wma, aiff, and others)
   - CD-Text support
   - Metadata support, fill CD-Text from metadata or via Internet queries (CDDB + Musicbrainz)
   - little gimmick: hide the first track (so that you have to search back from the 
     beginning of the cd to find it)
   - volume level normalization (only when writing with an image)
   - multiple sources for one track possible (merging of tracks, splitting of tracks, 
     adding silence of arbitrary length)
   - integrated "preview" player
   - Directly add audio tracks from other CDs and let K3b take care of the rest.
   
 - writing ISO9660-CDs and DVDs
   - Joliet/Rockridge support
   - Udf filestructures (no pure Udf so far)
   - create image/write image
   - writing on-the-fly
   - creating of file-tree via drag'n'drop (as easy as it could be)
   - removing files and directories from data tree
   - moving files within the project
   - adding new empty directories to data tree
   - renaming of files (manually or automatically for mp3-files) (for joliet and rockrigde)
   - support for most of the mkisofs-options (I don't think anyone will ever use them! ;-))
   - multisession support (including importing old sessions and overwriting files from old sessions)
     Automagically multisession handling: start, continue, or finish multisession CDs and DVDs based on 
     the size of the project and the remaining capacity on the media.
