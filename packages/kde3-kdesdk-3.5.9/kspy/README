KSpy
====

KSpy is a utility intended to help developers examine the internal
state of a Qt/KDE application. KSpy graphically displays all the
QObjects in use, and allows you to browse their properties. Using KSpy
is very simple, include kspy.h and call KSpy::invoke() when you want
to looks inside your app. The KSpy function is inline and the main
part of KSpy is dynamically loaded, so you may even want to leave this
in the release build of an application.
