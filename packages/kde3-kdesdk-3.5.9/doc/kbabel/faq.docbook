    <question>
      <para>
      Why does &kbabel; show question marks instead of language specific
characters after loading a <acronym>PO</acronym> file?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
      <para>
      The text contains characters, which can not be displayed with your system font. If you are sure, that the text contains no such characters, the file might have been corrupted somehow. In this case, mark such a question mark and press
      <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> to find all the corrupted characters and replace them.<note>
        <para>
        Do not search for real question marks, because these characters are only displayed as question marks, but internally they are different characters.
        </para>
      </note>
      Otherwise you might want to install an Unicode font, which contains all
      necessary characters.
