# To use this sample configuration file, copy it to ~/.kdesvn-buildrc, and then
# edit it to suit your desires.

# Global settings go in this section.  They apply to every module unless
# overridden later.

# binpath controls the value of the PATH environment variable during
# compilation.  If you have unusual tools that need to be in the path to build
# KDE, add them here.  KDE's and Qt's programs are automatically added.
	binpath /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
#	binpath /usr/lib/ccache/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin

# This is the directory that your KDE sources are downloaded to.  This
# directory also holds the build and log directories by default.
#	source-dir ~/kdesvn

# This is the Qt installation to use to build KDE.  The default is qt-copy
# from Subversion.
	qtdir ~/kdesvn/build/qt-copy

# You might want to use your system's built-in Qt already (3.3 or greater, not
# 4.x).  If so, assign the qtdir option appropriately.
#	qtdir /path/to/system/qt

# This is the Subversion server to download the KDE sources from.  Developers:
# Don't forget to add your username to the URL if necessary!
#	svn-server svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde

# This controls the configure flags passed to every module (except qt-copy) by
# default.  If you have module-specific configure flags, they will be placed
# after these flags to allow the module setting to override the global setting.
	configure-flags --enable-debug

# These are the compilation flags to use by default when compiling KDE.
# gcc supports a -march option in order to generate specific code for pentium4, athlon-xp,
# etc.  See the gcc man page for more information.
	cxxflags -pipe

# These are the default options passed to the make command.  The default tries
# to build with 2 parallel compiles.  If you are using distcc or have SMP, you
# should experiment with setting this value higher for best performance.
#	make-options -j2

# These are the default options passed to unsermake, which supports some
# options not present with make.  The default tries to run 2 compile jobs
# in parallel.  The -p option is used to display progress information.
#	unsermake-options --compile-jobs=2 -p

# This option is used to decide whether to use the unsermake build system, which
# is usually faster and more efficient than the standard automake-based build
# system.  It is generally stable enough to use, so it defaults to on.  You
# can disable this on a module-by-module basis if it gives you problems.
#	use-unsermake true

# This directory is where everything gets built before it is installed.  By
# default it is relative to the value for source-dir.  You can specify an
# absolute path if you'd like (begin the path with a slash).
#	build-dir build

# This is the directory that KDE will end up installed at.  The default is
# appropriate for a single-user installation of KDE, which requires no root
# permissions.  If you'd like, you can install and use the sudo program to
# install KDE anywhere on your system, in conjunction with the
# make-install-prefix option.
#	kdedir ~/kde
#
# You can overwrite the installation directory for a given module using
# the per-module "prefix" option. Note that when doing this you need to
# set KDEDIRS, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to both directories,
# and that you should use separate test users or KDEHOME values to separate
# the ksycoca databases. Only set prefix if you know what you're doing.

# If you would like install KDE to the system (DO NOT INSTALL *over* a prior
# installation!), then you'll probably need to use sudo to install everything.
# 	make-install-prefix sudo

# You can use the set-env option to add values to the build environment.
	set-env LDFLAGS -Wl,-O1   # Optimize the linker, takes longer.

# If you use software which requires pkg-config, and you need to add entries
# to your pkg-config path, you can also use set-env for that.  Some broken
# systems require you to set this to find e.g. glib.
#	set-env PKG_CONFIG_PATH /opt/gnome/lib/pkgconfig

# qt-copy is a copy of Trolltech's Qt, optionally with some bugfixes and
