If you want to test this new plugin:
launch
# make ; make install in this directory
then (to create the database)
# source compile
# cp scan ~/mytestdir
# cd ~/mytestdir
# ./scan file.po    (I suggest to download and scan $LANG.messages)

ok now you can launch kbabel, you should be in the same 
directory you launched "scan" from.

# kbabel


change kbabel settings to use  "DB Search Engine II" or use
CTRL+2 to search.
