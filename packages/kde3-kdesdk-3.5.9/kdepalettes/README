These are palettes for both the Gimp and Xpaint that match the KDE 
standard color palette. I thought they maybe useful to others designing 
themes and icons.

INSTALLATION:
Gimp
	Copy the file KDE_Gimp to ~/.gimp/palettes/. You can now access the
	palette by selecting File->Dialogs->Palette.
XPaint
	To make the KDE palette the default palette copy kde_xpaintrc to 
	~/.XPaintrc. Otherwise you can load it by selecting File->
	Load Palette from the image's file menu.
