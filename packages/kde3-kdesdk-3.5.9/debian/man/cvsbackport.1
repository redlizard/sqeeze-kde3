.SH NAME
cvsbackport \- backport the last change in HEAD to a branch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvsbackport
\fIfile\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
For each file given on the command line,
\fBcvsbackport\fP will attempt to determine the last change made to
the file in HEAD and then backport that change to a CVS branch (the
branch name is hard-coded; see below).
.PP
The changes to be backported will be displayed on screen, and you will
have the chance to confirm or abort before any commits are made.
.PP
The files must be checked out from HEAD when you run this utility.
.PP
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
.SH WARNINGS
The branch tag is hard-coded into the script (currently it is set to
KDE_3_4_BRANCH).
.PP
If you abort (i.e., you do not make the suggested commits), your files
will be checked out from the branch (and not from HEAD as they were
before).
