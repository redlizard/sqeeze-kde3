.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBKUIViewer\fP is a utility to display and test the user interface (.ui)
files generated by \fBQt Designer\fP.  The interfaces can be displayed in a
variety of different widget styles.

the given interface.
By passing the \fB\-\-takescreenshot\fP option, you can make KUIViewer dump a
screenshot of the interface instead and exit immediately.  Other options
are available to control precisely how this screenshot is constructed.
.PP
This application is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.

Below are the kuiviewer-specific options.
For a full summary of options, run \fIkuiviewer \-\-help\fP.
.TP
