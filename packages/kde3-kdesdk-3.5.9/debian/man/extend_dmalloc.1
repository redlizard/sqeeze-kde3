.SH NAME
extend_dmalloc \- analyse return-addresses from dmalloc logfiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extend_dmalloc
.I dmalloc-log binary
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBextend_dmalloc\fP will run
.BR gdb (1)
to get information on the return-addresses from a
.BR dmalloc (1)
logfile.  Specifically it will examine any \fIra=\fP lines and try to
get the corresponding line numbers.
.PP
The argument \fIbinary\fP must be the binary that generated the log
\fIdmalloc-log\fP.
.PP
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
.SH NOTES
You may wish to direct the output from extend_dmalloc to a file, since
otherwise gdb seems to prompt for a return as if you are at the end of a
page.
