.SH NAME
create_makefiles \- recreates all Makefiles beneath a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B create_makefiles
.I dir
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcreate_makefiles\fP recreates all \fIMakefile\fPs in
\fIdir\fP and its (recursed) subdirectories from the corresponding
\fIMakefile.am\fP templates.
.PP
This script must be run from the toplevel directory (the
one containing \fIconfigure\fP).
This script saves time compared to re-running configure completely.
.PP
If the source directory is different from the build directory (see the
environment variables below), it will be assumed that each \fIMakefile.am\fP
and \fIMakefile.in\fP belongs beneath the source directory and that each
\fIMakefile\fP belongs beneath the build directory.
.PP
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
One of the following variables (but not both) should be set if the
source
directory is different from the build directory.
If the build directory is simply a subdirectory of the source directory,
the simpler variable OBJ_SUBDIR should be used.
.TP
OBJ_SUBDIR
Indicates that the build directory is in the given subdirectory of the
source directory.  For instance, if the source directory is \fIkdesdk\fP
and the build directory is \fIkdesdk/obj-i386-linux\fP, then OBJ_SUBDIR
should be set to \fIobj-i386-linux\fP.
.TP
OBJ_REPLACEMENT
A \fBsed\fP expression that is used to transform the source directory
into the build directory.
For instance, if the source directory is \fI~/src/kdesdk\fP and the
build directory is \fI~/src/kdesdk-obj\fP, then OBJ_REPLACEMENT could
be set to \fIs#kdesdk#kdesdk-obj#\fP.
