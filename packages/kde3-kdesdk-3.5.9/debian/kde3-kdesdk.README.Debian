KDE Software Development Kit for Debian
---------------------------------------

Package kdesdk is a metapackage that depends on the core components of
the KDE Software Development Kit and suggests the remaining components.

Some applications provide documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
web browser, see the package kdesdk-doc-html.
