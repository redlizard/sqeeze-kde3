KDE Software Development Kit for Debian
---------------------------------------

The kdesdk-misc package includes palettes for both the Gimp and Xpaint
that match the KDE standard colour palette.  They may be useful for
designing themes and icons.

These palettes have been placed in /usr/share/kdepalettes/.
Instructions for installation are included in /usr/share/kdepalettes/README.
