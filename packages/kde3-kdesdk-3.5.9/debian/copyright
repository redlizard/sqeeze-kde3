  ANTLR:

  SOFTWARE RIGHTS

  ANTLR 2.6.0 MageLang Insitute, 1998, 1999

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public
  domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source
  code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including
  the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask
  that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean
  that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your
  programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
  acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
  etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the
  output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition,
  we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as
  these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system
  and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.

          **** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****

      The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
      software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL
      to be valid for this artwork library too.

      KDE Crystal theme icons is a special kind of software library, it
      is an artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical
      User Interface, or GUI.

      Source code, for this library means:
        - for vectors svg;
        - for pixels, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf
          or psd, or otherwise png.

      The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
      notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly
      useful.  With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place
      in the directory containing the elements. You may follow this practice.

      The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public
      License covers the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
