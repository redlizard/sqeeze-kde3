kdesdk-scripts for Debian
-------------------------

Debugger macros:

  Some handy gdb macros (such as for printing QStrings from gdb)
  have been placed in /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/kde-devel-gdb.

  To use them, add this line to your ~/.gdbinit :

    source /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/kde-devel-gdb

Editor helper files:

  Both vim and emacs helper files are provided containing many functions
  and keybindings for developing KDE/Qt/C++ applications.

  To use the vim helper file, add this line to your ~/.vimrc :

    source /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/kde-devel-vim.vim

  To use the emacs helper files, add these lines to your ~/.emacs (with
  your real name and email address substituted as appropriate):

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/kdesdk-scripts")
    (require 'kde-emacs)

    (setq kde-full-name "Your Name")
    (setq kde-email "Your Email")

  See the file /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/kdesdk-scripts/kde-emacs.el for
  further information regarding emacs.

Shell completion controls:

  Completion controls are provided in /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/completions/
  for a variety of shells.

  To enable completion controls for zsh, you need to add the following
  lines to your ~/.zshrc :

    # Add the KDE completion controls to the zsh function path.
    set -A fpath $fpath /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/completions/zsh

    # Initialise the zsh completion system.
    autoload -U compinit
    compinit

  To enable completion controls for bash, you must source each of the bash
  completion files from your ~/.bashrc .  A sample ~/.bashrc line is:

    . /usr/share/kdesdk-scripts/completions/bash/dcop

Valgrind error suppressions:

  A valgrind suppression file is included for ignoring things we don't
  care about when valgrinding KDE applications.

  The suppression file is provided as /usr/lib/valgrind/kde.supp .

  To use these suppressions, run valgrind with the option:

    --suppressions=/usr/lib/valgrind/kde.supp
