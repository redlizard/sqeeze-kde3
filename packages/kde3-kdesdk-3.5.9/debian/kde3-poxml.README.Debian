PO/XML tools for Debian
-----------------------

Overview:

  This package contains several tools for working with PO-files and
  DocBook XML files.

  Binaries included are:

    po2xml:   translates a DocBook XML file using a PO-file
    split2po: creates a PO-file from two DocBook XML files
    swappo:   swaps msgid and msgstr fields in a PO-file
    transxx:  creates a basic fleshed-out PO-file from a PO-template file
    xml2pot:  creates a PO-template file from a DocBook XML file

  Please see the relevant manpages for further information on each tool.

Warning:

  The PO/XML tools are fussy about system identifiers (unlike some other
  XML processing tools).  When writing DocBook XML files, if a DTD is
  declared then a system identifier must be included also.

  Thus (for example) the following declaration is invalid, and will cause
  the PO/XML tools to break:

    <!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.1//EN">

  On the other hand, both of the following declarations are acceptable:

    <!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1//EN"
        "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1/docbookx.dtd">
    <!DOCTYPE article>

  See "DocBook: The Definitive Guide" (in the docbook-defguide package)
  for further information.
