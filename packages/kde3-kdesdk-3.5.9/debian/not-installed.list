The following files are not installed in any binary package.
This is deliberate.

/usr/share/man/man1/cvscheck.1
 - This manpage is junk, so we don't ship it, and include our own instead.

/usr/bin/kunittest
/usr/bin/kunittest_debughelper
 - These are not useful without the dcopperl bindings which are not built
   in the Debian kdebindings packages.

/usr/bin/licensecheck
and the associated manpage
 - devscripts has taken this script
