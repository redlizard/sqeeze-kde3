  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

kdesdk (4:3.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * First g++-4 upload to sid.
  * Adjusted build-dependencies and shlibs files for the C++ ABI transition.
    Note that the libcvsservice0 package name does not need to change.
  * Updated FSF address in the copyright file.
  * Changed the conflicts on kdevelop3-plugins to a versioned replaces as
    described in the changelog for 4:3.4.0-0pre2.
  * Removed redundant xlibs-dev recommendation from kapptemplate.
  * Adjusted Ivan's changelog entry from 29 Feb 2001 to 01 Mar 2001 so the
    changelog is parseable.
  * KBabel now treats multiple-line headers correctly (closes: #277341).
  * Bumped standards-version to 3.6.2.1 (no changes required).

kdesdk (4:3.4.0-0pre2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in recent packaging changes from the 3.3 branch.
  * Introduce a temporary conflicts against kdevelop3-plugins, which provides
    a copy of the subversion I/O slave taken from kdesdk-misc.  This will be
    removed once kdevelop has been rebuilt against KDE 3.4 (without the
    subversion I/O slave), and a versioned replaces will be put in place
    instead.
  * Now that KDE has moved to subversion, disable cvs-clean in debian/rules
    for the time being.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat, 14 May 2005 19:20:58 +1000

kdesdk (4:3.4.0-0pre1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New major upstream release.
  * Note that although libktnef.la has moved from kdepim-dev to libktnef1-dev,
    a build-dependency on kdepim-dev is still required for some header files.
  * Removed cvs dependency from cervisia, since this comes indirectly through
    libcvsservice0 anyway.  Updated the cvs dependency for libcvsservice
    to require cvs (>= 1.11), as cervisia used to when it handled cvs itself.
  * Removed obsolete kderemove tags from menu items.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2005 12:56:49 +1100

kdesdk (4:3.3.2-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fresh pull from KDE_3_3_BRANCH for recent bugfixes.
  * Many thanks to upstream who have relicensed cervisia under the GPL
    (closes: #296514).  Also noted in debian/copyright that cvsservice is
    under the LGPL.
  * Fix kdemangen.pl output to use minus instead of hyphen where appropriate,
    thanks to Achim Bohnet (closes: #295454).
  * Fixed amd64/gcc-4.0 build by using longs for node IDs in kcachegrind,
    thanks to Andreas Jochens (closes: #287032).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Mar 2005 19:59:13 +1000

kdesdk (4:3.3.2-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed drag-and-drop problems in umbrello that can cause a real and/or
    apparent loss of data (closes: #296433).
  * Patched kbabel spell-check-as-you-go to use checkWord() instead of check(),
    which seems to protect it from the kdelibs crash described in #289646.
  * Added the full text of the GFDL to debian/copyright, since all of the
    docbook documentation is under this license.
  * Added a note to README.Debian in the poxml package regarding the
    necessity of system identifiers (closes: #286103).
  * Installing the new script cvsforwardport and a corresponding manpage.

kdesdk (4:3.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    build-depends to >= 4:3.3.2 accordingly (closes: #291592).
  * Fixed setupGUI() typo in kapptemplate (part of #289304).
  * Added a README.Debian for poxml that outlines the available binaries
    (closes: #286106).
  * Applied upstream patch for poxml that addresses escaped literals
    and KDE-specific credits in split2po (closes: #288929).

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Jan 2005 07:29:29 +1100

kdesdk (4:3.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build-depends on kdepim-dev (>= 4:3.3.1), which provides libktnef.la.
    When building against libkcal2-dev (>= 4:3.3.1), libktnef.la is needed
    at link time.
  * Also changed libkcal2-dev in the build-depends to the versioned
    libkcal2-dev (>= 4:3.3.1) to ensure consistency.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Dec 2004 08:16:17 +1100

kdesdk (4:3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release.
  * Build-conflicts with autoconf2.13, which does not play well with
    Makefile.common.
  * Force a rerun of admin/Makefile.common when building (not just after
    a clean), since the debian patches affect Makefile.ams.

kdesdk (4:3.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New package kcachegrind-converters.  These foreign format converters
    are packaged separately so that kcachegrind need not depend on php.
  * Binary package kmtrace has returned.  Note that the kmtrace libraries
    for debian are now installed in /usr/lib/kmtrace, not in /usr/lib as
    is done upstream.
  * Versioned libqt3-mt-dev build-depends is no longer necessary since
    kdelibs4-dev already forces Qt 3.3.
  * Made libcvsservice-dev depend on kdelibs4-dev.
  * Removed python dependency from poxml, since all apps are now compiled
    binaries.
  * Added a sample kde-buildrc to the kdesdk-scripts documentation.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Oct 2004 09:55:26 +1000

kdesdk (4:3.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    just www-browser.
  * KBabel catalogue manager no longer opens spurious empty windows
    (closes: #237031).
