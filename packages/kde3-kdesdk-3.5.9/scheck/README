Scheck - An interface style to highlight accel and style guide conflicts

When starting an application with "KDE_LANG=xx application --style check"
scheck will, for text parts it checks, strip the "xx"s and display the ones
missing them (missing i18n() calls/.desktop entries) with violet background.

To use it: "program -style check". Yes, there should be a verbose README.

In short:

- Orange shows accel conflicts.
- Green proposed accels.
- Dotted red lines show nested groupboxes (not prohibited, but not favored :-).
- Potential style guide violations are marked with yellow, likely ones with red.
- Missing colons are drawn with two small red squares.
- Errors in window titles are marked with "foo|b|ar".
- Violet background show untranslated string.

Note: Not everything is checked (like list/combo box choices) and
scheck is error-prone so read HIG[*] and think before you change anything. :-)
