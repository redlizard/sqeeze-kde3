KSVG 0.1 - Release TODO List
--------------------------------------

Task															
We should be done for 0.1 with the feature
set as promised, years ago :)

Make it nice:
- idea: offer a tool to select a rectangle to zoom into (like asv has)
- idea: offer a preview widget like in karbon/kghostview to easily navigate/pan around a drawing
