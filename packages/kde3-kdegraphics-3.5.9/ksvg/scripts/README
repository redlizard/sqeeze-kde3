This document explains how to generate a SVG C++ header/sourcefile pair :

1. go to dir idl
2. copy the svg.idl file to the classname you want to generate, for example SVGRect
3. edit the newly created file to only include the class info, delete the rest
4. run ../gen.sh classname (without extension) to generate the pair

Caveats:
1. all inheritance specification must be on the same line
2. no support yet for exceptions, comments
3. this works for mawk 1.3.3, with slight adjustments it should run for 
   other awk implementations
