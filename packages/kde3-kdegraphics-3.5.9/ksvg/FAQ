Q: Why do my fonts look wrong when trying the offical
   W3C Testcases? (they don't fit in the boxes)

A: Those testcases all use a font called 'Helvetica',
   your system may use Verdana instead, which is also
   wrong. I suggest you replace the following line
   in your XftConfig file:

   match any family == "Helvetica"     edit family += "Verdana";

   with

   match any family == "Helvetica"     edit family += "Arial";
