KGHOSTVIEW for KDE 3.x

This is Tim Theisen's Ghostview program ported to the K
Desktop Environment. Ghostscript is used to view PostScript
documents on Unix X11 systems.

REQUIREMENTS

1. GNU ghostscript
2. KDE 3.x

If ghostscript works for you then so should KGhostview. ghostscript can be obtained
at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/.

Due to security reasons, kghostview works only with recent versions of ghostscript.
Versions greater or equal to than GNU version 6.53 or GNU version 7.05 should work.

Other versions or implementation of ghostscript may or may not work. In the
configuration dialog, found under the Settings menu in the app, it
is possible to configure the interpreter to use.
