- Port to KViewShell / KMultiPage

- Progress bar(s) when loading/converting (the latter can be very slow).

- Find dialog.

- Different icons for Read Up and Read Down.

- Use pdftops which comes with xpdf for pdf->ps conversion. It's output 
  is much better, and it allows the conversion of selected pages, which is
  important when you want to print a small number of pages from a large
  document.
  I don't think I'll switch to pdftops. Ghostscript also has the possibility
  to convert selected pages only. And for printing its output is fine. 

- Provide more information via statusbar messages. See gsview, for how it 
  should be.

- Move the page navigation options from the View menu to the Go menu. 
  Currently Konqueror doesn't merge the Go menu, so that should be fixed first.

- Fit page to view-width, auto-zoom on widget resize.

- Better handling of Orientation and Paper Size choice.

- Continuous and Continuous Facing viewing of pages, like Acroread.

- Find a good solution which helps the user to keep his eyes focused when
  scrolling (smooth scrolling or using helper lines like gv).

- Fix all the bugs.


Done:
- Scrollbox should show a thumbnail (like kdvi).

- New implementation for the marklist because QTableView won't be in Qt-3.0 
  anymore. (I'll keep using QTableView, simply because there's no suitable
  alternative in Qt3.)

- Switch to the DSC parser provided by Ghostscript.
