ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT / URGENT BUGFIXING

o improve performance and perceived performance (see also under 'highly desirable')

o do not render the same PS code more than once if all pages have the same PS code
o add "papersize" which does not display the margin
o get rid of useless README.kdvi
o Proper handling of the base-url
o add "tt.dvi.gz" to the list of recent files, not "/tmp/kviews....."
o If one presses PgDn for a while, kdvi spends minutes browsing through pages...

HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Speedup, in particular for ghostscript and glyph enlarging.

o Support papersize information given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.

o asynchronous rendering of pages, so that browsing with pg up/down looks faster


NOT SO URGENT

o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o more robust Error handling with throw/catch; no need to abort just because a PK-file is bad.
