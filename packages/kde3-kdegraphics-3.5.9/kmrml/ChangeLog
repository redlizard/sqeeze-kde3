Uh er, looks like I didn't add all the other changes lately :} Sorry...

	* UI is a bit nicer now (arrangement of thumbnail items)

	* it's possible to search by example, i.e. by right-clicking
	on one or more images and selecting "search for similar images"

	* tiny bit of code cleanup

	* argh, fixed the bug that files couldn't get downloaded by
	clicking on them and that the statusbar isn't updated.
	casts suck :} That took me a lot of time to find out :(

	* added middle-button -> create new window

	* scroll to top when loading a new page

	* show standard popupmenu on right-click on image

	* schedule the slaves instead of creating all at once

	didn't do any entries until something is actually working :)
