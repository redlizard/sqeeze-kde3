- Konqueror Properties dialog for indexing directory? Or just a context menu entry?
- make use of BrowserExtension, provide the actions
- contextmenu
- better layouting?
- better keyboard support
- progress report from slave
- transfer mrml in chunks as data arrives?
- finish algorithm configuration
- integrate with KPaint so you can paint an example image
- integrate with kamera, so that images from your digicam will be indexed automatically
- create Konq ContextMenu plugin instead of the ServiceMenu thing (mrmlsearch binary)
- proper browserextension (restorestate/savestate, history, implement actions)
- a panel applet or tray app KDirWatching indexable dirs and re-indexing on demand

lots more probably
