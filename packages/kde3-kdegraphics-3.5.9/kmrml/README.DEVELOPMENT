This file gives an overview of the structure of the kmrml package.

kmrml consists of the following:

- kio_mrml: an ioslave that is able to contact an mrml daemon (i.e. the GIFT)
            and transports the data from the daemon to its master (i.e. the 
            MrmlPart) as XML (MRML, Multimedia Retrieval Markup Language)

- MrmlPart: the konqueror-embeddable controller and view 

- mrmlsearch: a small tool that is e.g. called from Konqueror's ContextMenu
              "Search for similar images" to start an image query.

- kcontrol/: a KDE Control Center module for configuring parts of the GIFT,
             i.e. indexing directories, specifying GIFT hosts, etc.

- server/: a kded module, i.e. a tiny little daemon, that can be told via
           DCOP to start, restart upon failure and automatically/manually 
           stop services. It is completely independent of GIFT/kmrml.
           It is used to have one centralized place where the gift server
           is started (ensuring this happens only once, restarting it upon
           failure and stopping the gift after all kio_mrml instances 
           have been killed.

lib/: common stuff used by more than one module
