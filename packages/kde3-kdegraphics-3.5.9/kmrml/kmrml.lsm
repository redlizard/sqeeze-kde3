Title:          MRML for KDE -- Content based image retrieval
Version:        0.3.2
Entered-date:   2001/06/05
Description:    MRML is short for Multimedia Retrieval Markup Language,
                which defines a protocol for querying a server for images
                based on their content. See http://www.mrml.net about MRML
                and the GNU Image Finding Tool (GIFT), an MRML server.

                This package consists of an mrml kio-slave that handles
                the communication with the MRML server and a KPart to
                be embedded e.g. into Konqueror.

                With those, you can search for images by giving an example
                image and let the server look up similar images. The query
                result can be refined by giving positive/negative feedback.
