	* config/kviewviewerpluginsconfig.cpp:
		Don't show an empty config page in the pluginselector (there are no
		KView plugins with config options, yet).

2003-08-22  Matthias Kretz <kretz@kde.org>

	* confmodules.*
		moved to kviewcanvas/config
	* generalconfigwidget.ui
		moved to kviewcanvas/config

	* kviewvieweriface.h:
		Everything is gone, let's see if this interface will stay
		around...
	* Makefile.am:
		Added own messages target
	* kviewviewer.{h,cpp}:
		Remove image cache again. It's making more problems than it's
		worth. The speedup is minimal. A real speedup would probably be
		to preload images and/or cache the QPixmaps.
		Problems I had: At some point no new image would be shown
		anymore. Also the memory usage was too high and the kernel
		does disk caching anyway, so the QImage caching is just a
		minor optimization.

	* kviewviewer.cpp:
		s/QUriDrag/KURLDrag/

2003-03-11  Matthias Kretz <kretz@kde.org>

	* kviewviewer.cpp:
		uhm, fix a biiiig memory leak: the cache wasn't deleted on
		part destruction

2003-03-06  Matthias Kretz <kretz@kde.org>

	* kviewviewer.desktop:
		Changed MimeType field to support pbm, pnm, ppm and pgm. And
		added the image/jp2 type.
		Name change: Image Viewer Part -> KView Image Viewer. Somehow
		the part needs to be identified with KView.

2003-03-04  Matthias Kretz <kretz@kde.org>

	* kviewvieweriface.h:
		New interface header. This is probably going to be KView
		specific stuff or become a DCOP interface (or both) have to
		look into that some more...
		It has only one method so far: setCacheSize( uint ) for
		setting the maximum size of the QImage cache of the viewer.
	* kviewviewer.cpp:
		Cache QImages in a QCache.
		This introduces a few problems: If a newer version is
		available on file the cache will be used because the
		modification time isn't checked.
		Also the watching of files doesn't work anymore if the image
		is loaded from the cache.
	* kviewviewer.{cpp,h,rc}, kviewviewer_ro.rc:
		added "rotate clockwise" and changed icon of CCW (patch by
		Adriaan de Groot)
