How to write a plugin for KView
===============================

There are two different kinds of plugins for KView that you may write: KPart
plugins for KView or the KView KPart (KViewViewer).


Writing the Plugin
==================

You have to derive your plugin from KParts::Plugin and install the rc file under
the directory "data" (KDEDIR/share/apps/ usually)+"instancename/kpartplugins/"
(where instancename can be either kview or kviewviewer). If you install it under
kviewviewer the plugin will be loaded for the KPart (meaning it get's loaded in
e.g. Konqueror).  If you install it under kview it only get's loaded when
starting the KView application.

The parent that is passed on to your plugin will be a KImageViewer::Viewer
interface (which is also a KParts::ReadWritePart) if you make it a KViewViewer
plugin, else you'll be passed a pointer to KView (take a look at the template
plugin to see how to get to the KImageViewer::Viewer interface).


Plugin Desktop file
===================

Now you need to write a .desktop file for your plugin, containing the name,
a comment, author, email and plugin name.

Here's a start:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Coolplugin
Comment=This is a very cool plugin doing foo and bar
Type=Plugin

[X-KDE Plugin Info]
Author=Matthias Kretz
Email=kretz@kde.org
PluginName=kviewcool
Version=1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "PluginName" entry needs to be the same as the name attribut in your .rc
file (<kpartplugin name="kviewcool" library="kview_coolplugin">).


Examples
========

There are a few modules already in the original KView sources. Just take a look
at kdegraphics/kview/modules/*.
