TODO - KPdf MAIN HEAD
Legend:

    FIX - FIXed (bug or regression)
    MRG - MeRGed (code from a branch or a patch)

In progress:
  -- 2005-Feb-26: Merge from 'kpdf_annotations' branch --

More items (first items will enter 'In progress list' first):
-> pageview: add scrollbar marks for bookmarks (like kate)
-> screen editing (annotations): framework (BR67300,BR62793)
-> screen editing (annotations): tools (BR67300), yellow notes 'post-it' like
-> go to next/previous bookmark actions (showing in thumbnailslist rmb popup too)
-> viewport restoring: sometimes it seems to restore the viewport a bit under where it was
-> viewport restoring: save the page width setting between runs (save/restore zoom factor)
-> presentation: provide a pageX/totalPages indicator in addition to the circle one
-> cleanup code and update README.png
-> search: use shortcut for 'find next' action (not the default one) in find-ahead
-> show Viewport in ThumbnailsList (blended/contour)
-> Delay TOC (DocumentSynapsis) generation (and move it on thread)
-> add a way to handle "named xpdf links" in KPDFLink instead of resolving all destinations
   when displaying a page (speedups a lot generation of page with many links)
-> refactor ThumbnailsList to do internal rendering as pageview does (way faster
   than using QScrollView + inserted Widgets and saves 8% on document loading)
-> usability: layout 2PPV [1 2,3 4,5 6] -> [1,2 3,4 5]. add option for 'ebook' style alignment
-> usability: trigger redraw on 'filter text' on current page (need new highligh engine first)
-> abstract TextPage generation (the last xpdf dependant class!). then go dancing in the
   streets.
-> Dom framework to cache document metadata. It should archive those types of data:
   (NOTE: already Dom'ed object is marked with 'X')
   - <X> Synopsis will go there after 1st generation (so we can edit it too)
   - <X> Document info (after the 1st gen)
   - <X> Bookmarked pages
   - <X> Current Viewport and 10 history steps
   - Edited pages (rotated/with_data for example)
   - Overlay editing (hilighting/notations/etc..)
   - Presentation related overrides (FS mode, individual / global transitions)
   - ..more stuff.. but this isn't a problem, since a QDom is flexible by design
   The Object will reside into the Document and must not be accessible by Oservers in
   a direct way. Dom format, relations to other classes and accessing must be specified
   in a separated diagram or text file.
-> add kpdf manual in PDF format loaded on the first startup or on menu->help->manual
   this visually explains basic usage, mouse buttons functions & more..
-> take care of TODOs in code
-> ADD: click over image allows "save image" [60% done (activerect of type image)]
-> export all text in plain_text/html
-> extract(export?) images (have a look at ImageOutputDev.cc and pdfimages.cc from xpdf (not in our xpdf sources))
-> text selection in wordprocessor style (very hard)
-> zoom: fit text (with configurable margin)
-> bookview: 3d opengl widget for viewing the document as a real book (turning pages, etc..)
-> open gzipped (.pdf.gz?) files
-> kspeech TTS interface. speech {document / page / selection(done)}
-> automatic online dictionaries / translators (BR80338)
-> core: pdf forms support
-> add OCR for building TextPages out of pure graphical (aka scanned) pages
-> rotate the whole document / individual pages - Have a look at the fifth parameter of displayPage, it is the rotation, so it should not be THAT hard to implement
-> presentation: implement missing transitions (6/11 done)
-> presentation: add some gfx tools (like a red pencil)
-> presentation: save a flag (to the xml) to open a pdf in presentation mode
-> presentation: wheel not visible on black. gradient appreciated on lighter backgrounds.
-> investigate 'Splash' lack of smoothness at low resolutions (see lines in thumbnails)
-> add search on the toc widget (a 'prune on type' lineedit like in thumbnails widget)
-> goto 'logical' page (usually differs from pdf's page) (req. by Luca Burrelli)
-> use shortcuts for next and prev page even in presenatation mode (by Tobias Koenig)
-> move some document related features from part to the document (see find, goto dialog, ...)
-> Albert: Read pdf specification and see if paths with length = 1 are allowed, in case they are allowed see how to fix 97131 without skipping paths with length = 1
-> tools: ruler, measure: distance, perimeter, ?area?, color picker
-> export: export to other formats keeping formatting (a dream.. except for PNG :-) (PS is easy, we just have PSOutputDev that does it :-D)
-> history as a toolbox child (collecting Doc's viewport changes notifications)
