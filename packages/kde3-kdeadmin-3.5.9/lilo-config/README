lilo-config is a kcontrol plugin for configuring LILO, the most commonly
used Linux boot loader.

Parts of the code (basically all the code that does the real work) are designed
to be UI independent (if I ever have the time, there will be a textmode
frontend), which is why I'm using "String"s rather than "QString"s throughout
the code. Please don't change this.
