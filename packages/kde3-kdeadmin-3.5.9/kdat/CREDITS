All versions of kdat prior to KDE-2.x were developed and/or
supported by Sean Vyain (svyain@mail.tds.net).  Starting with
KDE-2.x, Larry Widman (kdat@cardiothink.com) volunteered
to serve as maintainer because the package was about to be
dropped for lack of a maintainer.

It is unclear what happened to Sean.  One email correspondent
reported that he had been killed in a car crash.  The KDE 
coordinator said that multiple attempts to contact him by email
had been unsuccessful.

Anyone who has information about Sean Vyain, who has made many
contributions to the Open Source movement, would be appreciated
and may be directed to Larry Widman (email address above).

Re legal stuff.  The copyright to the kdat source code up to 
when maintainership changed is owned by Sean Vyain.  If he is
in fact deceased, the copyright ownership presumably passes to
his estate.  Any representative of that estate should feel free
to contact the current kdat maintainer in case licensing issues
should arise in the future.
