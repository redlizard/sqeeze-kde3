Kpackage handles RPM, Debian and various other packages, it is used
for displaying currently installed packages, uninstalling
them and installing new ones. 

For kpackage to work correctly with RPM packages the RPM database 
must be initialised. If typing `rpm -qa' gives an error about 
`unable to open....` then try `rpm --rebuilddb'.
