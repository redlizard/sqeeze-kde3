Common Mistakes
---------------
If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at ftp://ftp.trolltech.com
and download the latest Qt 3.3.x release.


Debugging
---------
You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.


More Info
---------
You can use --without-shadow, if you do not want to have shadow support.

You can use --without-quota, if you do not want to have quota support.
