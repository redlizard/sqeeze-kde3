1. Introduction
KNetworkConf is a KDE Control Center module to configure  the Network 
settings in a Linux machine. I developed it because I couldn't find any
application to do this from within KDE, and I think this is a "must have" 
app for a serious Desktop Enviroment like KDE.

KNetworkConf features:

* Configure installed network devices (you can't add new ones for now) 
in basic and advanced mode (ie. don't auto configure broadcast and 
netmask values).
* Autodetection of wireless interfaces. 
* Configure the default gateway and gateway device. 
* Configure host and domain names. 
* Add/remove DNS servers (/etc/resolv.conf). 
* Add/Remove known Hosts (/etc/hosts). 

KNetworkConf works now in 15 different platforms: 

* BlackPanther OS
* Conectiva Linux
* Debian Linux
* Fedora Linux
* FreeBSD
* Gentoo Linux
* Mandriva Linux
* OpenNA Linux
* Polish Linux Distribution
* Red Hat Linux
* Slackware Linux
* Specifix Linux
* TurboLinux 
* Vine Linux

KNetworkConf uses the Gnome System Tools (gst) 
(http://www.gnome.org/projects/gst/) network backend to find out the network 
values in a platform-independient manner. This backends are a bunch of perl 
scripts that use XML files to communicate with different frontends. 

NOTE:You don't need to have GNOME nor GST installed AT ALL to run 
KNetworkConf. The network backend comes included. 

2. Requirements
* KDE 3.1.x
* Qt 3.1.x
* Perl
* libxml
* autoconf > 2.5x/automake > 1.6

3. Installation
For installation instructions, please see the INSTALL file, but for
a quick start you can do:

./configure
make
su root
make istall

Mandriva users must add --prefix=/usr to the configure script to
install the files in the correct path and run update-menus after make install.
