konversation (1.1~-rc1+svn837068-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream development snapshot (1.1rc1+ #3235):
    - Revision: 837068; Date: 2008-07-23 20:59:29 +0300 UTC by hein.
    - The latest translation and documentation are included (as of
      Thu, 23 Jul 2008 22:38:12 +0300).
    - 3 or more crash fixes since 1.1rc1 which is in testing. Hence urgency
      medium.

  * New upstream development snapshot (1.1rc1+ #3230):
    - Revision: 834660; Date: Sat Jul 19 12:23:39 2008 UTC by scripty.
    - The latest translation and documentation are included (as of
      Thu, 21 Jul 2008 09:49:20 +0300).
    - Fixes another crash on close (DCOP quit) (Closes: #491332).
  * Remove 16_konversation_desktop.diff - merged upstream.
  * Remove konversationircprotocolhandler.1 manual page. Excess since some
    time now.
  * Update konversation.install file.
  * Urgency high to reach testing in time before freeze. Fixes regression
    (crash).

konversation (1.1~-rc1-1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
  * New upstream development milestone (1.1 RC1):
    - Should fix the crash on close (one of them at least) (Closes: #490226).
    - No more bashisms in the script (Closes: #489621).
  * Urgency medium because previous svn snapshot, which has already been
    tested for a number of days in unstable, is not much different from this
    one. I really want 1.1~ to replace 1.0.1 in testing.
  * Update install file.

        there is activity in that chat window.

    hackish way to achieve the same thing (i.e. not to installing upstrem
    README) which should not cause problems with dash as /bin/sh
    (Closes: #459159).

    * Add unfuzzed kubuntu_02_serverlist_compiz_workaround.patch as
      17_serverlist_compiz_workaround.diff. The patch comes from
      upstream r604746  (KDE Bug #147557).

      I understand how it helps for Ubuntu.

  * Documentation is provided under the terms of GNU GFDL with no Invariant
    Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. Mention this

    /usr/share/common-licenses/GFDL in debian/copyright.
  * Use more strict wildcards in konversation.install mostly to track
    upstream changes and to eliminate empty apidox directory.
  * New/updated patches:
    - 10_debian_channel.diff - update to use port 7000 for irc.debian.org
      by default to prevent possible DCC exploit.
    - 12_dbug405384_dccsendfile.diff - remember whole URL (including protocol),
      not just directory for "Send File" dialog (Closes: #405384).
    - 13_dbug412894_lowercase_nick.diff - don't crash on typing text in
      reopened query/channel after all channels/queries were left (lowercase
      nicknames were not affected) (Closes: #412894).
    - 14_dbug412803_assert_crash.diff - avoid a possible crash on DCOP info.

  [Modestas Vainius]
  * Update debian/copyright based on current copyright information in the
    source code.
  * Migrate from simple patch system to quilt.
  * Patches:
    - 01 to 04. Usual libtool & autotools update.
    - 06_fix_relibtoolization.diff - remove a few redundant _LIBADD directives
      from Makefile.am files to make relibtoolization possible.
    - 10_debian_channel.diff - add irc://irc.debian.org/#debian to server list
      by default.
    - kubuntu_01_kdepot.diff.diff - drop this patch because I don't see why it's
      needed. Current code leads to the same result.
    - 11_dbug_autoreplace.diff - add Debian BTS (dbug) auto replace. Thanks to
      Filipus Klutiero for the idea (Closes: #419897).
    - 98_buildprep.diff - relibtoolization patch.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of obsolete ${Source-Version} for the -dbg
    package.
  * Changes to debian/control:
    - Drop versioned dependency on g++.
    - Drop reduntant build dependency on libqt3-mt-dev.
    - Drop autotools runtime from build dependencies. They are no longer needed.
    - Build depend on autotools-dev for config.guess and config.sub.

      be re-run at build time, and this is not desirable.  I don't have time

  * Add konversation-dbg, to help trace problems (and remove my previous,
    less-elegant method of conditionally including debug symbols).

  * Recommend python; it is used by the media and weather scripts.

  * Remove ancient Conflicts and Provides declarations for konversation-doc
    and konversation-i18n.  I believe these packages were never uploaded to
    the official Debian archive, and were definitely removed long before the
    sarge release.

  * Remove the .svn check in debian/rules in favor of passing -i to

  * debian/{control,copyright}: merged in some minor changes from my proposed
    0.13-2 package
  * debian/patches/000-authors.patch: deleted (applied upstream)
  * debian/patches/002-del-empty-docs.patch: new patch: do not package the
    empty README and NEWS files
  * debian/rules:
    + install examples/dcop-away.sh executable, as linda does not like it
      otherwise, and some other packages also do this (exim4, autotools, ...)
    + make usr/share/apps/kconf_update/*.pl executable as well, for a similar
      reason (quiets lintian, and there is precedent for either way)

  * Moved snapshot packages to experimental dist. (actually did this with the
    previous build, but forgot to mention it in the changelog)
  * New CVS snapshot.
    + Post freeze commit :) This commit does the following:
      * Add systray notification (it's disabled by default and still buggy so
        use with care or risk going crazy ;))
      * Add shell like nick completion mode (aka uga mode). It's a bit
        primitive at the moment though. The default is the old cycle through
        nick list.
      * A cleaner way of handling tab shortcuts.
      That's all for now I think :) [psn]
    + Layouting fix for nick completion preferences page [abatianni]
    + Updated authors [abatianni]
    + Moved close button settings into new prefs page [abatianni]
    + Moved general tab settings to new prefs page [abatianni]
    + Fix cycle completion so that it adds the configured extra chars [psn]
    + Fix event handling for the systray notification [psn]
    + Show shell like completion possibilities in chatwindow [psn]
    + Keep the case of the nicks in the completion list [psn]
    + First very rough implementation of DCC Chat (receiver side) [abatianni]
