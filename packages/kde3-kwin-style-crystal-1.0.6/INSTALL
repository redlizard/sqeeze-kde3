-- INSTALL -----------------------------------

Basic Installation (from the console):
  - Step 1
      $ ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`
  - Step 2
      $ make
  - Step 3 (as root)
      # make install

If configure fails, check that you have both
the Qt and KDE development headers installed.

You need at least KDE 3.2 and QT 3.3.

Debian note: You may need to append
--with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3
to the configure line.
