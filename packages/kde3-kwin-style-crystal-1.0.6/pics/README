These are the button themes for Crystal.

1) embedtool: Tool wich converts the png files into C-source code. The source code is then compiled into the decoration.
Use with 'embedtool file1 file2 > tiles.h', or 'embedtool foo/*.png > bar.h'.


2) The button themes are handled by automake now, this means a simple 'make' in the top directory should build embedtool, create the neccessary headers and copy the resulting tiles.h to ../client/tiles.h. After changing a png file, a simple make should take care of it all. 


3) A new button theme is much more work:
- Add a directory, populate it with png images. List this directory in the ${themes} variable of the Makefile.am
- In the top directory run: make -f Makefile.cvs. Now make should include your png images in the tiles.h, which gets included in the crystal source.
- You have to add some logic to the ../client/crystalclient.cc and ../client/config/configdialog.ui file, to really make your button theme available.



If you made a button theme out of an existing one, please mail it to me (at spam84@gmx.de), and I'll take care of the proper implementation.
