Description: semi transparant window decoration for KDE
 Crystal offers you pseudo transparent titlebar, buttons and borders
 transparent, so you can see more of your lovely background image
 Transparancy and buttons can be costumized to match your wishes.
 Offers rounded corners as well
 .
 And it is of course nice to look at. Upstream says:
 "- Don't forget to breathe, while drooling."
