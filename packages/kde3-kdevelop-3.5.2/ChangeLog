2007-12-03  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* Added a QtRuby4 project based on the C++ Qt4 one

2007-10-16  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* Added Rails 2.0 file type suffixes; .html.erb, .js.rjs and .xml.builder

2006-12-13 Matt Rogers <mattr@kde.org>
	* KDevelop 3.4 RC 2 (with many more things than listed here)

2006-11-08 Matt Rogers <mattr@kde.org>
	* KDevelop 3.4 RC 1 (with many more things than listed here)

2006-08-06 Andreas Pakulat <apaku@gmx.de>
* Implemented Support for Qt4 qmake in the qmake buildsystem
  # Recognize the QT option
  # Support RESOURCES variable
  # cleanup the configuration
  # provide an import configuration for Qt4 projects

2006-04-26 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
* Made the ClassView restore it's state after a refresh. It will no 
  longer close up after each successful build.

2006-04-24 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
* Added "Goto Last Edit Position" action. A regular menu/toolbar/shortcut 
  action to open the file and position the cursor at the point of the 
  last edit.

2006-04-14 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
* Improved support for encodings
  # KDevelop will now obey the selected encoding in the File Open dialog
  # The OpenWith plugin now offers all available encodings in "Open As"
  # The encoding for each open file is saved with the session, and will
    be used to open that file the next time the project is loaded
  # Default encoding can be set per project in the Project Options -
    this will be the default when opening a file
  # File Open encoding will default to the open project's default

2006-04-07 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
* Added KDevShellWidget - a thin wrapper around konsolepart, aimed at
  executing shell type applications.

2006-03-25 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
* Added support for multiple tags files for Ctags2 plugin, enabling
  it to optionally cover external libraries in addition to the active
  project. Work based on patch by Etay Meiri.

2006-03-15  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* Added a 'sync terminal' option to the configuration settings to
  disable the 'cd' commands in the konsole by default.

2006-02-21  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* Disable the new file sidetab by default

2006-02-21  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* Add the pid to the filename of the Unix domain socket used by the ruby
  debugger so that more than one instance of KDevelop can be run on a
  machine.

2006-02-21  Richard Dale  <rdale@foton.es>
* The Full Screen mode menu option is under the Settings menu in both
  Kate and Konqueror, and they arguably have it in the wrong place.
  But it's probably better to make KDevelop consistent with other KDE
  apps even if they're slighty wrong. So move the menu under settings

2006-02-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* Removed the 'Type' column from the Ruby debugger as the C++
  debugger no longer has one

2006-01-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* Added a minimal C# language project type based on the perl one.

2006-01-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* Added file templates for Rails projects; rhtml, rxml, css and js
* Fixed documentation links for QtRuby/Korundum, added some
  links for Rails

2006-01-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* Added a Rails project template
* Use the Run menu option to start WEBrick. If the Rails project doesn't
  exist it will be created.
* The script/console runs in the Terminal instead of irb

2006-01-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* Added .ocl extension for Onboard Control Language sources used for
  C files in some satellites

2005-08-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
* The $SHELL environment variable is set to 'irb' for ruby projects.
* Added a project option to customise the ruby shell
* A 'def cd(dir) Dir.chdir dir end' line must be added to your
  .irbrc file to prevent syntax errors when konsole changes directory

2005-06-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
  * Fixed bug in 'run main program' project option where the .ui file was out of
    sync with the code
  * Add a 'show constants in debugger' project option. This is needed because there
    are so many constants in the qtruby/korundum classes that it slows the debugger
    right down and clutters the variables view.
  * Added a 'Trace into Ruby' project option to show ruby code from installed libraries
    in the debugger.
  * The debugger can now expand instance variables nested within instance variables
    using get_instance_variable().
  * Improved the parsing of pretty printed items that are all on one line, as opposed to
    one line per name=value pair.

2005-06-25 Pieter Pareit <pieter.pareit@scarlet.be>
  * Added ruby_{run,config} icons, the .png files are used by kdevelop,
    the .psd files can be used by artists when icons need to be changed
    Thanks Zoran Karavla for the artwork!

2005-05-26 Tobias Erbsland <te@profzone.ch>
 * Added new class QtBuildConfig. This class stores the configuration
   about the used Qt library. Is Qt used, which major version and
   where the Qt library path (QTDIR) for this project is.
   In a later step, it's possible to use different qt installations
   for each project. E.g. you develop on a KDE4.x programm under KDE3.x.
 * Added a new tab in the C++ options dialog (CCConfigWidget).
   The user can edit the configuration QtBuildConfig in this tab.
 * New class wizard:
   - Qt checkboxes are disabled (hide them?) on non-qt projects.
   - Different code is generated for Qt3.x and Qt4.x projects.
   - Includes of classes that starting with "Q" bypasses the
     normal template settings. In Qt3.x the include file has always
     a lowercase include name with a ".h" suffix, and Qt4.x has
     a mixed case include name without any suffix.
   - Added the email address to the author's name if it exists.

2005-05-26 Tobias Erbsland <te@profzone.ch>
 * Replaced static hash table in lexer by a QMap
   I found no performance impacts by this replacement, but the code
   was getting much smaller and cleaner.
 * Added Q_DECLARE_FLAGS and Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS macros
   that are used in Qt4 for the special QFlags template.
 * Added the keyword (macro) "foreach" to the lexer and parser that
   is introduced by Qt4.
   In a later step I will add the correct parsing, that the initial
   variable is identified by the parser that code completion works.

2005-04-05 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Added support for CVS' annotate command

2005-03-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
 * Added missing ruby debugger icons installation

2005-03-01  Matt Rogers <mattr@kde.org>
 * Fix bug 71926 by not using beautifyToolTip since it breaks i18n
 * Fix bug 71708 by giving the environment variable dialogs a parent
   so they can't get hidden behind other windows

2005-02-23  Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Fix compilation on KDE 3.2

2005-02-22  Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>
 * Added partial support for building kdevelop with cmake

2005-02-22  Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Added a qmake parser to help implementing a much better qmake project
   manager

2005-02-17  Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Add the 'Configure Toolbox' and 'Edit Custom Widget' menu items back to
   the tools menu when designer intergration is activated.

2005-02-07  Matt Rogers <mattr@kde.org>
 * Pull information from the CVS/Entries file to populate version control
   information in the file tree on first load. This eliminates the need to
   use 'Sync with Repository' when KDevelop is first loaded, but it is needed
   to update the version control info.

2005-02-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
 * Fixed Java KDE app framework template so it compiles

2005-02-01 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Implemented a fix for BR 91757 which also removes the silly runtime dependency we had on kdebase

2005-01-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
 * Added a Ruby KConfig XT project template

2005-01-25 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Reimplemented "Forward" for source navigation history

2005-01-23 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
 * Updated support for Doxygen up to 1.4.1

2005-01-22 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Global scope plugins are once again optional.
 * Fixed source navigation history (by reducing the ambition to something that can work).
 * Added the Version Control Manager plugin. Now we can decide which VCS system to use again. :)

2005-01-20 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Further cleanup of plugin handling in PluginController/ProjectManager.
 * Removed the last traces of in-project language switching.

2005-01-09 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Finished the new CTags frontend.

2005-01-08 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Made it possible to finally remove Code Completion databases via the GUI
 * Cleaned up the context menu mess (at least it's optional now, and the code
 is cleaner).

2005-01-03 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Added support for CVS commands edit, unedit and editors

2004-12-19 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Made it possible to add custom build commands (like make install-exec)
   for the subproject context menu in automake manager.

2004-12-17 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Advanced subclassing option in C++ New Class Wizard can be used
   for classes in the persistant class store. This means that if
   the PCS for Qt library is built then advanced subclassing from
   Qt classes is possible in the wizard.

2004-12-15 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Finished the implementation of plugin profiles for KDevelop shell
   and shell extension architecture.
   This means that KDevelop IDE becomes a KDevelop Platform now. And
   KDevelop IDE is now only a program built on KDevelop Platform.
 * Made KDevelop Assistant to use KDevelop Platfrom.
 * Implemented profile detection for projects. Now, for example, when you open
   C++ language project KDevelop loads "CppIDE" profile. If a project file
   has KDE keyword set then KDevelop loads "KDECppIDE" profile (profile defines
   a list of plugins to be loaded and unloaded). kdevprofileeditor will show
   all information related to the profile.

2004-11-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added some ruby project options which are used for both debugging and an
   ordinary run.
     - Main program (this is in addition to the automake project main program)
     - Program arguments
     - Run main program or run selected window options
 * The '-K' character coding project option is now passed to the debugger too

2004-11-22 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Implemented simple VCS integrators for Clearcase, Perforce and Subversion.
 * Reenabled subversion support plugin.
 * Imported svn kioslave from kdesdk HEAD into a compat library therefore svn
   will work on KDE<3.3.90 too.

2004-11-21 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Added KDevVCSIntegrator extra interface. VCS Integrator is a plugin which is used by
   application wizard to select a version control and possibly import newly created project
   into the VCS.
 * Implemented VCS integrator for CVS (Cervisia).
 * Patched ProjectManager to load selected VCS plugin.

2004-11-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Ruby Source Code Debugger initial checkin
 * Based on John Birch's gdb front end, the UI is very similar. There are no
   assembly language step options or disassembly viewers, but pretty much
   everything else is much the same in ruby as for gdb/C++.
 * You can set breakpoints on file/line or file/method, watchpoints to break when
   a ruby expression is valid and catchpoints to break when an exception is thrown.
 * The Watch variable viewer allows ruby expressions to be watched, and they are
   updated on program pause.
 * A configuration option was added to enable/disable the debugger floating toolbar.
 * The debugger backend is written in pure ruby using the code from the 'debug.rb',
   source included with the ruby distribution. It is started via KProcess which handles
   redirection of stdout and stderr. The idea came from the way Laurent Julliard
   implemented the FreeRIDE ruby debugger - it uses Distributed Ruby (like DCOP)
   for messaging. DRuby is ruby-specific and couldn't be used though.
 * The debugger communicates with the backend via a Unix domain socket;
   commands are sent, and the replies are parsed in KDevelop in much the same way
   as the gdb debugger uses stdin and stdout to send and receive.

2004-11-17 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * KDevelop interfaces cleanup and enchancements. Interfaces are now smaller, additional, not so important
   interfaces are available through extension mechanism (see KDevPlugin::extension() methods).
   Also added a lot of API documentation.

2004-10-30 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Implemented "grouping of snippets" feature for SnippetPart

2004-10-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed ruby class and instance variable type matching bugs
 * Added error message if the ruby code to run can't be located by the top level C++ stub
 * The default character coding for KDE ruby projects is UTF-8
 * If a class is declared several times in a file, the line number of the first instance
   is used in the class browser, and not the last one.

2004-10-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added the 'qmakeapp' project template translated to QtRuby

2004-10-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed Ruby KDE app and DCOP service templates so they work again.
 * Implemented a 'Character Coding' ruby project option

2004-10-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Implemented ruby class '@@' and '@' instance variables in the class browser.

 * Ruby doesn't have declarations for class or instance variables, and so a variable is 'declared'
   when it is first  assigned to. So the first assignment encountered in the ruby source is used,
   unless the variable is set in the iniitaiize() method when that is considered as the 'first'.

 * The type of the variable is inferred from the type of the thing on the rhs of the assignment to it.

2004-10-27  Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
 Exclude non API classes from the doxygen API documentation.
 Please use the "doxygen doxyfile" command to test it.

2004-10-27 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    The first step in creating RubyQt/Korundum RAD environment -
    started to implement KDevDesigner integration for Ruby:
    works: automatic and manual subclass creation;
    doesn't work: function adding, editing and removing.

2004-10-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a ruby DCOP service project template
 * Improved the kapp Korundum application framework. It configures, builds and installs
   a C++ top level stub, that starts the ruby app. The ruby scripts are located via the
   KStandardDirs/KInstance mechanism, in directory ..share/apps/<appname>
 * k_dcop and k_dcop_signals declarations are shown as slot and signal declarations in
   the class parser.
 * =begin to =end comments are ignored
 * Added icons for Ruby configure and run options. The Run button now starts the main program
   with the ruby '-C' option to switch to the main program's directory.
 * Added missing scope attribute to the class parser methods


2004-10-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Implemented ruby slots/signals declaration navigation in the class browser
 * Atrr accessor and access control method lists can span multiple lines

2004-10-23 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    * KDevelop documentation viewer and KDevAssistant:
      - implemented font configuration options;
      - disabled loading of KHTML plugins.

2004-10-21 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    * KDevelop Platform:
      - implemented profiles library and editor engine;
      - implemented profiles editor (kdevprofileeditor application);
      - set up X-KDevelop-Property properties in .desktop files of KDevelop parts.

2004-10-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a KDE Korundum Ruby application framework based on the languages/cpp/app_templates/kapp
   C++ project template
 * Improved the Ruby class parser
 * Both classes and modules are shown in the class browser
 * Class or 'singleton' methods supported and appear as 'static' methods
 * Access types of 'public', 'protected' and 'private' supported
 * attr_accessor, attr_reader and attr_writer method definitions supported. For attr_accessor or
   attr_writer a 'foo=' method is shown.
 * Operator methods are shown in the class browser too

2004-10-13 Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>
    *buildtools/custommakefiles/:
    -add two submenus "Object Files" and "Other Files" to the "Build Targets" menu
    -add new tag <filelistdirectory> so that the filelist file can be
     located outside the source directory. This is currently only written
     by the cmake kdevelop3 project file generator

2004-08-27 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Updated support for Doxygen 1.3.8

2004-06-21 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Added drag and drop support to SnippetPart
    * Added filter support to AppOutputView

2004-06-17 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added optional automatic reload on external file modification. This is only available with katepart.
    * Added CopyTo plugin. A small utility to do network transparent file copying using KIO.
    * Disabled VCS repository creation in the appwizard (doesn't work and the implementation broke the
      plugin handling) and import (to be reimplemented using KTrader).
    * Added the simple basics of Plugin Profiles. Will finish this the coming days.

2004-06-14 Alexander Dymo <adymo@mksat.net>
    * Documentation plugin can show methods in index for Qt and Doxygen documentation catalogs.
    * Implemented a dialog to run profiler (calltree + kcachegrind).

2004-06-05 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Fixed several ToolView related issues. Among other things, they should now
      automatically restore their last position after a restart.

2004-05-31 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * KDevelop has made a large step towards being the RAD tool for KDE.
      Qt Designer is ported to KParts and KXMLGUI technology and can now
      be embedded into KDevelop and integrated with it. It consists of
      KDevDesignerPart and KDevDesigner shell program. Part is embeddable
      everywhere and shell can be launched as standalone designer (run kdevdesigner).
    * The first step to integration between KDevDesigner and KDevelop is done.
      CppSupport can now automatically create implementation files (subclasses) for forms
      and automatically add slot implementations.

2004-05-27 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Change "New File" in the toolbar to popup a menu with all available file templates,
      if one clicks on it.

2004-05-26 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Added possibility to set the priority of the make-process
    * Added possibility to search case insensitive

    * Added a ncurses template

2004-05-10 Andras Mantia <amantia@kde.org>
    * Add possibility to define environment variables for the configure stage.

2004-05-08 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Devhelp and KDevelopTOC documentation plugins are implemented. Indexes that exist
      in devhelp and kdeveloptoc files are now taken into account.

2004-05-04 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Doxygen documentation plugin (toc and index) is implemented.
      This means that kdevassistant can browse KDE API docs and has table of contents and index!
      kdevassistant (and kdevelop itself) is now the first documentation browser where you can
      look for Qt and KDE classes at the same time (using one index).

2004-04-30 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Added Paul Drummond's patch for having "favourites" in appwizard.

2004-04-25 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Added support for reading the licenses that appwizard uses dynamically. Install all current licenses
      to $prefix/share/apps/kdevelop/licenses

2004-04-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added brand new "Look in documentation" function that puts the term under the cursor into the
      documentation index tab and looks up for this term in the index.
    * Added "Search in Documentation" and "Look in Documentation" menu items into the "Help" menu
      with shortcuts <Ctrl+Alt+S> and <Ctrl+Alt+I> respectively.
    * Implemented "Goto manpage" and added "Goto infopage" function in the "Help" and editor context menus.
    * Improved "Add bookmark" function - it now recognizes embedded html part and sets the bookmark title
      to the title of an opened document.
    * Use also a default KDE shortcut for popup menu to open editor context menu.

2004-04-21 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added Gtk-- application template by Andrew Patterson.

    * Wired up katepart's editor context menu - we now finally have copy/paste in the context menu.
    * Added a keyboard shortcut to open the editor context menu. (CTRL+Return)

2004-04-16 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added MimeWarningDialog - KDevelop will now ask the user what to do when an unknown mimetype is encountered.

2004-04-15 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added Thomas Nagy's KConfig XT based apptemplate.

2004-04-14 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Rewrote and documented the KDevPartController interface to reduce the duplication of a lot of common but
      trivial code all over the codebase.
    * Moved the documentation history out of the PartController and into the docviewer part.
    * Moved source navigation history into the PartController and disabled the HistoryPart.

2004-04-14 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Here is my gift for all Qt Designer fans! A KDevelop Assistant program is now available (run kdevassistant
      from a command line). KDevelop Assistant is a lightweight version of KDevelop with only documentation
      and file selector parts enabled.

2004-04-12 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Full text search in new documentation part now functional. Search results are presented in html page
      and in listview as well.

2004-04-09 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Commited new documentation part for KDevelop. It features documentation plugin system,
      it's easy now to add support for a new documentation format by implementing DocumentationPlugin interface.
      Index is now loading faster, index caching mechanism is used. Configuration dialog became more clean and convenient.

2004-03-22 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Restructured CppSupportPart::parseProject()

2004-03-17 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Extended diffpart to also handle FileContext and dirty files.
    * Updated FileList. Now supports filestate feedback and has a context menu for file operations.
    * More cleanups in Core. Filestate is now emitted from PartController for the receivers to implement.

2004-03-15 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * NewMainWindow is now enabled by default
    * Added settings in "User Interface" for TabWidget visibility and IDEAl mode button layout

    * A few other minor improvements to the core.

2004-03-05 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Reimplemented how FileTree finds selected items. Fixes crash when a file changes name from an external event.

2004-02-24 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added FileList plugin
    * Added CTags2 plugin

2004-02-23 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added Opie application templates for C++/Embedded development. Templates by Holger Freyther.

    * src/projectmanager.cpp: ask if user tries to reload the already opened project

2004-01-26 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added snippet part by Robert Gruber.

2004-01-24 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Updated Bookmarks Plugin. Various improvements and fixes.

2004-01-21 Andras Mantia <amantia@kde.org>
    * Fix clear all breakpoints functionality

2004-01-21 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added ConfigWidgetProxy class to lib/util and initially implemented demand loading of config pages for DocTreeViewPart.

2004-01-09 Amilcar Lucas <a.lucas@tu-bs.de>
   * Easy access to bug reports of every supported language in the documentation browser (except SQL)

2004-01-07 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
   * Updated support for Doxygen 1.3.5 cvs HEAD

2003-11-28 F@lk Brettschneider <falkbr@kdevelop.org>
   * old IDEAl look for toolview-buttons is back in IDEAl mode

2003-11-20 F@lk Brettschneider <falkbr@kdevelop.org>
   * latest sync with KMdi of kdelibs-cvsHead (fixes some crashes)
   * enabled kmdiguiclient.h/cpp for KDE less version 3.2 too
   (-> this introduces KDE-accels Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L/R/B/T for IDEAl-docks and Ctrl+Alt+CursorLeft/CursorRight for cycling IDEAl-toolviews)
   * bugfix: proper names of View menu
   * now save the docking state to another section of kdeveloprc (to let people (who tried KMdi alpha versions) escape a vicious cycle)

2003-11-16 Mario Scalas <marioscalas@agilemovement.it>
    * Version control color feedback for the file view (currently implemented
      by vcs/cvsservice plugin only).

2003-11-13 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Readded a even cleaner kdevelop.kdevelop file.
    PLEASE do _not_ commit changes to this file.
    We have until mid January 2004 to make the necessary code changes that create a more "cvs friendly" file by moving some of the options to the .kdevses file.
    For info on how to do it, read:
    http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/cvs-api/kdevelop/html/howToAddPlugins.html
    I think this is very important fo the success of KDevelop3 in for developer teams (no man is an island!).
    Alexander and F@lk seam to agree with me on this one.

2003-11-09 F@lk Brettschneider <falkbr@kdevelop.org>
    * as planned and decided months ago, now I
      removed KDevelop's own special implementation of IDEAl UI mode.
      This has been replaced by KDE's IDEAl UI mode, globally implemented in kdelibs/kmdi.
      Now we increase maintainance, KDE-comformity and can switch all KDevelop UI modes on the fly.

2003-10-29 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Imported updated pascal parser, it isn't restricted now to pascal-78.
      Most object pascal/delphi extensions are supported.

2003-10-17 Dominik Haumann <dhdev@gmx.de>
    * new Application templates in cpp: kateplugin2, noatunvisual,
    noatunui, kbearimportfilter, kbearplugin, kfileplugin
    * fixed 53943, 64028
    * parts/appwizard: Now you can add "ShowFilesAfterGeneration=file1,file2"
    to the app_tamplate's information-file (example: khello/khello) so that
    file1 and file2 are shown after project generation - usually a README.devel
    and/or source code files the user has to modify.
    ShowFilesAfterGeneration= takes a comma separated list of files regarding to
    the project root directory wheras
      - APPNAMEUC will be replaced with the projectname.upper()
      - APPNAMELC will be replaced with the projectname.lower()
      - APPNAME   will be replaced with the projectname.
    Function 'openMainFile()'is now deprecated and therefore removed.
    * updated documentation for this stuff.
    * new in New-Project-Dialog: Getting the Project location with "..." asks
    if it should set tht directory to the DefaultProjectsDir.

2003-10-13 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Moved the language specific documentation to the languages/xxx/doc directories

2003-10-12 Mickael Marchand <marchand@kde.org>
    * New subversion part added to replace the old svn one

2003-10-11 F@lk Brettschneider <falkbr@kdevelop.org>
    * now I've started again fixing the MDI user interfaces which are quite broken at present

2003-10-08 Tilman Vogel <Tilman Vogel web de (dot at dot)>
    - added auto completion to the namespace field
    - added classes from all namespaces to the auto completion of the base
      class field, add classes from specified namespace without qualifier
    - lookup classes for parsing in the correct namespace, not only the global namespace
    - fixed bug causing crash when changing inheritance mode

2003-10-04 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Reenabled Ada language support (ported it to code model and reenabled
      background parsing).

2003-10-04 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * On-line, automaticaly updated every 24H, KDevelop API Documentation can be viewed with the doctreeview.

2003-10-02 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Renamed KDevelop executable from gideon to kdevelop.
    * This makes KDevelop3 OVERWRITE KDevelop 2.x instalations.
    * Restructured the directories acording to the API documentation
       buildtools -> has the old Project managers
       languages -> language support (includes app_templates, file_templates, compilerplugin, pcsimporter and debugger)
       editors -> editors support
       vcs -> Version control systems (clearcase, cvs, perforce, svn, cvsservice and cervisia)

2003-09-26 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Added per target run arguments to the automake manager.
      These arguments are used when no Main program (Project Options...-> Run Options) is selected and the Program arguments  (Project Options...-> Run Options) are left empty.

2003-09-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Finished GUI for enabling and disabling documentation topics in a project configuration
      dialog. Thanks to Amilcar Lucas for original idea and implementation.
    * Added popup menu for the documentation viewer. It contains "Open in New Window", "Reload",
      "Stop" and "Set Encoding" actions.
    * Created mimetypes directory in KDevelop source tree. Here we can put all mimetypes necessary
      for KDevelop that are not available in kdelibs.
    * Added x-fortran, x-pascal and chm (HTML Help) mime types.

2003-09-10 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added the GUI to create custom code completion databases
      based on user selected directories.
    * Imported Kugar property editor library. Modified generic project manager
      to use it for editing properties in build item configuration dialog.

2003-09-09 Dominik Haumann <dhdev@gmx.de>
    * parts/appwizard/appwizarddlg[base.ui,.cpp]: fixed bugs 45719, 63930, 63929

2003-09-08 Roberto Raggi <roberto@kdevelop.org>

    * Some updates on the "KDevelop 3.0 users's manual" (docbook)

2003-08-29 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added the initial version of generic project manager.
      It is the replacement of script/custom/pascal/ada/haskell/etc. project managers.
      Extensible with plugins. Currently available project manager based on shell scripts.

2003-08-28 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * SQL support now displays tables and fields in the classbrowser

2003-08-27 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added language support on the fly - you can switch to
      SQL mode from a CPP project, or to Perl if you have scripts

2003-08-26 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added version information for plugins to prevent opening
      binary incompatible plugins from old versions.

2003-08-10 jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Roger Larsson's patch that adds remote debugging.

2003-08-03 jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * fixes for debugger startup problems
    * fixes for debugger shutdown
    A significant change in this patch is that we no longer attempt to
    shutdown gdb from information that gdb supplies. This must now be done by
    the user via the stop button.
    A reproductable crash after the client program segfaulted and the user
    tried to continue, shutdown and then restarted has been fixed.
    I suspect that this was the major cause of the reported crashes judging
    from the few backtraces supplied.

2003-07-28 Mario Scalas <mario.scalas@libero.it>
    * PartExplorer is now shown in the embedded SelectView because the dialog-based interface was hardly useful!
    * Results list will now use tooltips to show available services' properties.
    * Several bugfixes in GUI code

      automake subproject options dialog and to the "Libraries" tab of the
      automake target options dialog.

2003-07-25 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added "Force Reedit", "Install" and "Install (as root user)" actions into the subproject
      menu for Automake Manager. Force Reedit is only available for KDE projects.
    * Quote environment variables with double quotes to allow shell expansion when
      launching make from the project manager.

2003-07-19 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * QEdtior can now Reload files

2003-07-15 Andras Mantia <amantia@freemail.hu>
    * resolve links before opening a local file
    * add "-follow" as a switch for "find" to successfully grep even in symlinked directories

2003-07-14 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * If no Main Program was selected in Project Options...-> Run Options, then use the
      currently selected active target. This is valid for execution and for debugging.
      So no more need to goto the menu every time you want to debug a new target! Just
      activate it and you're done! :)
      Currently only in Automake based project because AFAIK it the only one that has
      the concept of active targets. Correct me if I'm wrong.

2003-07-13 Andras Mantia <amantia@freemail.hu>
     * don't treat libtool link messages for modules as errors.
     * recognize libtool warning messages.

     Doxygen generated documentation under "Related Pages > Todo List"
   * Make Doxygen generate XML files for the codecompletion tooltips

2003-06-18 Mario Scalas <mario.scalas@libero.it>
        * (CvsPart) New features added:
          - It is now possible to add to/remove files from .cvsignore file
          - When adding/removing files to project, part will now ask for user action
        * (CvsPart) Code has been restructured.
        * (lib) Modified FileContext in kdevecore.{h,cpp} so it can handle KURL::List.
          (This is just an addition: old code should work as before).
        * (FileView) FileTreeWidget supports multiple files selections now. Removed
          drag support because it needs to be fixed by TT (seems a bug from qt-3.1.2
          onward).

2003-06-15 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added notification if a file has been modified outside the IDE
      (IDEAl mode only for now).

2003-06-14 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added perforce to the main menu, also uses KActions now so you can
      assign your favourite keybinding to the commands.

2003-06-14 Hamish Rodda <rodda@kde.org>
    * Warn if another process is running on execution and allow a restart.
    * Make automake deal with METASOURCES=AUTO
    * Remember position in document for compile warning/errors so that you can
      edit the document and still be taken to the correct location
      (work in progress, commented out, requires up-to-date katepart)
    * Separate highlighting for errors and warnings (work in progress)

2003-06-12 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Trollproject:
      - Existing files could be added to a project with a relative path or
        they could be symlinked instead of just copying
      - Implemented removing files from IMAGES and IDLS groups
      - Set run environment variables and program arguments when launching
        the executable (thanks to Mario Scalas for the patch)
      - Correct "Link convenience library inside project" functionality (thanks to
        Mario Scalas for the patch)

2003-06-11 Hamish Rodda <rodda@kde.org>
    * Implemented "Debug in KDevelop" hook into drkonqi (the KDE crash
      handler). Press the button and kdevelop attaches to the process
      and brings up the frame stack, as long as the binary name of the
      process is the same as your binary.  Requires an update to
      kdebase/drkonqi to work (runtime dependency).

2003-06-07 Mario Scalas <mario.scalas@libero.it>
        * Stepped back from using Pimpl in part design since it does only complicate code without any of its
          advantages in this case
        * Added an option for adding the message for the commit operation to the master ChangeLog
          (located in <projectDirectory>/ChangeLog): await for comments for further changes.
        * CommitDlg now uses QTextEdit instead of (deprecated) QMultiLineEdit
        * This log was written using the CvsPart! :)

      the default source formatter part. Astyle library is separated from the part.
    * Added "Format Source" option to the "C++ New Class" wizard.
    * Added an index system to the doctreeview - thanks to Marcel Turino <M.Turino@gmx.de>.

2003-05-16 Jakob Simon-Gaarde <jakob@simon-gaarde.dk>
    * Trollproject: Support for custom installation groups or qmake install objects
      Each install object tells "make install" to copy user specified filesgroups to
      a certain location.
      example:
         doxy.files += docs/*.html \
                       docs/*.css
         doxy.path = /usr/doc/appname
         INSTALLS += doxy

      compiler plugins for Free Pascal compiler and (very basic) for Borland Delphi Compiler.

2003-04-18 Roberto Raggi <roberto@kdevelop.org>
    * started to implement the recovery support, this is the first
      step to implement the incremental parser

2003-04-17 Roberto Raggi <roberto@kdevelop.org>
    * Reduced the size of the generated pcs database(you must regenerate your
      database using r++ to take advantage of it)
    * Added the AST node for variable function arguments
    * Added option "--fast" to the r++

2003-04-16 Roberto Raggi <roberto@kdevelop.org>
    * Implemented the support for class inheritance in the new pcs

    * Added the new persistant class store

2003-04-15 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * The stop-button is now able to stop single parts via drop-down menu.

2003-04-14 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Updated integrated Doxywizard (Doxygen Configuration GUI) to 1.3 version.
      This maintains full backward compatibility with previous Doxygen versions.

          - Okay -> OK
          - Referring to generated names like Layout36 is a bad idea

        * Separated project options widget in 4 separate widgets
          instead of one tab widget and embedded them
          into the general project options dialog. This is
          more intuitive for the user and doesn't expose
          KDevelop's internal structure so much
        * App wizard fixes and improvements in the project file structure
        * Configurable builddir (not used yet)
        * Configurable environment variables for program run

2001-06-05 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Reenabled the signals when files are loaded and
          saved, so Bernd can test ;)

          Not quite ready
        * Bug fixes in sub project and target options dialog
2001-06-02  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New sub project and target options dialogs.
          These are much more user-friend wrt convenience
          libraries and include directories within the
          project. Furthermore, the libtool options are
          presented in documented check boxes
        * Put compiler options widget into the project
          options framework
2001-06-01  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

2001-05-31  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added a Java JNI based plugin api, and a corresponding
          project template for building a plugin. Java parts are
          not built if a --without-java flag is used for configuration,
          or if no suitable versions of javac, jar etc are found.
2001-05-31  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a zillion other languages to ctags tag mappings

        * Added python documentation index
        * Made file view aware of files added to and
          removed from the project

        * Fixed project management regexps for tabs
        * Fixed project management to properly emit addedFile signals

          based C and C++ programs
2001-05-23  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Fixed file view and made it possible to add new
          groups and change the order of matched patterns
        * Added preliminary fortran support part with a
          ftnchek configuration dialog. Parser follows later...
2001-05-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a new part 'FileView' which shows all files of
          a project sorted in groups like 'Sources' and
          'User Interface'. The groups can be configured
          by the user. A default setting is provided by the
          application wizard.
2001-05-20 Sandy Meier   <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * added initial PHP support including a simple php parser
        * added "hello world" PHP template to AppWizard

          (breakpoints etc.)
        * Added cast methods to the editor interfaces, so
          you don't have to pass strings around any longer
2001-05-19  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added kicker, kioslave and kcmodule templates
        * Each template can define an icon which is

        * The Big KInstance Cleanup
2001-05-19  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin to provide and configure a
          Tools menu.
2001-05-17  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Categorized all parts into Global or Project,
          so that they are either loaded at startup or
          at project loading time
        * Added part selector which allows to configure
          the used parts both globally and on a per-
          project basis
2001-05-14  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Back to KDialogBase for configuration dialogs
2001-05-13  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a project options dialog to which any
          plugin can add a tab.
        * Debugger configuration dialog
        * Temporarily gone back to QTabDialog for these
          configuration dialogs instead of KDialogBase.
          Not sure if this is right...
2001-05-13  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

        * Added a status interface to the editor interfaces
        * Implemented display of editor status in the main
           statusbar
2001-05-12  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Changed compiler frontend to use QTextView, instead of QListBox.
          Now copy&paste are possible, and the view scrolls to the end of the
          output (unless the user has clicked otherwise)
        * Also fixed the shortcuts
        * Fixed buffer menu for documentation parts
2001-05-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Commited the new editor framework
          Note that it is not yet active, as it is not yet
          complete. But it is evolving...
2001-05-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added Python Hello world template
        * Fixed memory leaks
        * Fixed project files in templates to include mainprogram variable

          file when it is clicked
        * Implemented printing
2001-05-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented proper comparing of file identities:
          Instead of the file name, now devno/inode are compared.
          Important for NFS systems, where file names may have
          a prefix like /tmp_mnt in some occasions
          This was already implemented in the HEAD branch
          before the old one ;-)
        * Implemented KDevCore::gotoFile() as a generic method
          to "go" to a file. Works for arbitrary mime types.
        * Implemented KDevCore::revertAllFiles()
        * Warning dialogs when modified files are closed or when
          saved/loaded files were modified outside.
        * Implemented searching html widget
2001-05-08  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Use flex instead of $(LEX)
        * Made function prototypes in tokenizer.l static.
          Not making them 'static' explicitly makes them
          'extern' and causes a conflict
        * Removed tokenizer.cpp from cvs, so it gets
          generated at build time
2001-05-05  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

        * prepared the Tip-of-the-Day plugin to make use of the
          KTipDialog class that will soon appear in kdelibs.

        * Removed hard coded java classpaths, and classnames. They are derived
          from the projectDirectory and mainProgram project attributes.
        * Checked in jdb front end code from Oliver Strutynski. He comments:
          'I finished work on a first version of JDB Support. It is not at
          all feature complete (setting breakpoints does not work yet, hangs
          from time to time) but could serve as a starting point for further
          development. The directory contains a README describing some of the
          parsing in the jdbcontroller.'

        * some changes in appwizard gui (qtdesigner based),
        templates can have a category property now
2001-04-27  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented a generic project part for scripting languages.
          It essentially consists of a widget that displays all files
          in all subdirectories.
        * Changed the class view to respect the feature set of the used
          language. I.e. for example for python the sections with
          variables are not displayed, as in python variables are not
          declared.
        * Sanitized project loading: The user now chooses the project
          file in a file dialog, not the directory. The kapp, kpart
          and kpartplugin appwizard scripts install a project file now.
        * Replaced the persistence stuff (which was not yet used) in the
          classstore with serialization routines based on QDataStream.
          In principle, we could now send them around via DCOP :-)
        * Implemented a python support part with parser
        * Implemented a perl support part with parser
2001-04-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Made configure arguments configurable
          Patch by Berndt Josef Wulf <wulf@dingo.ping.net.au>
        * Don't link with libfl in cppsupport and javasupport
        * Each part now uses its own instance and the corresponding
          resource directory
2001-04-18  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * GDB debugger part sources copied to 'parts/javadebugger', and all names
          changed to JDB ones. Ready to add jdb functionality.
2001-04-17  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Moved the splitter widget to lib/util, so it can be shared with parts
        * Moved the editor part to lib/kwrite, to allow parts to access it.
        * Added astyle part, a source code reformatter.
2001-04-13  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Applied patch from Oliver Strutynski to fix bug in the Java tokenizer
          with non US-ASCII identifiers in source files.
2001-04-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin that let's you select the parts to load
          on startup
        * Added some code to core to only load the plugins selected.
2001-04-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added memory view widget
        * Fixed disassemble widget to act only when it is visible
        * Added examine core file and attach to process
        * Cleaning widget after the debugger has finished
        * Added status bar text and whats this
        * Clear execution point mark when debugger has finished
2001-04-10  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * added a part to display a "Tip of the day"
        * moved over the tips from the previous HEAD branch,
          which probably need a review
2001-04-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Rewritten the icon border stuff from 1.x for use
          with multiple views per document
        * Ported the debugger frontend
2001-04-06  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added Java and Objective-C class browsing, and Java KDE project template and
        automake support (ie the _JAVA primary). Fixed bug in class browser where a
        method's arguments were not being displayed (was that a bug or a feature?).
        Clicking on a class's instance variables in the class browser now works and
        takes you to the source file.
