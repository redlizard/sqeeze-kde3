\requirement <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">QMake</a> >= 3.0.3

\todo <b>Relative directories (priority 1)</b>
  By default a qmake projects created with kdevelop must be distributable,
  therefore all directory-selections must be relative the subproject where
  it is used (user can override this ofcourse). So when a select-directory
  dialog is opened getRelativeDirectory() (#include pathutil.h) should be
  called.
\todo <b>Ignore shell-expressions and qmake-functions (priority 2-3)</b>
  FileBuffer should recognize and ignore shell-expressions and qmake-functions.
