KDE API Documentation
---------------------------
If the KDE API documentation does not exist, it can be created
as follows:

  Install doxygen and the kdelibs sources. Then

  make apidox
  make install-apidox

After that you should follow the instructions at:

http://www.kdevelop.org/index.html?filename=branches_compiling.html

to compile KDevelop


For the graphical classbrowser, you need the program 'dot'
from the graphviz package which can be downloaded from
www.graphviz.org. This is only a runtime dependency!

If you are experiencing build problems related to .moc files, try
  rm *.moc*
  make force-reedit
in the source directory where the build system complains.
