/**
Application frontend interface. 
This interface is responsible for handling the running of an application in KDevelop.
Currently, this interface defines ways to do the following:
- check if the application is running;
- execute the application;
- stop the currently running application;
- control the output view as seen in the 'Application' tool dock.

Instances that implement this interface are available through extension architecture:
@code
KDevAppFrontend *apf = extension<KDevAppFrontend>("KDevelop/AppFrontend");
if (apf) {
    // do something
} else {
    // fail
}
@endcode
