KDevelop make frontend interface.
This is the abstract base class for plugins that are able to run "make"
or similar commands to build a project, api documentation, etc.

Instances that implement this interface are available through extension architecture:
@code
KDevMakeFrontend *mf = extension<KDevMakeFrontend>("KDevelop/MakeFrontend");
if (mf) {
    // do something
} else {
    // fail
}
@endcode
