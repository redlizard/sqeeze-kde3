KDevelop diff frontend interface.
This is the abstract base class for plugins that want to display differencies between
files.

Instances that implement this interface are available through extension architecture:
@code
KDevDiffFrontend *df = extension<KDevDiffFrontend>("KDevelop/DiffFrontend");
if (df) {
    // do something
} else {
    // fail
}
@endcode
