KDevelop for Debian
-------------------

1. Persistent Class Store (code completion)
-------------------------------------------

The format of the Persistent Class Store (PCS) used by KDevelop for code
completion changed in KDevelop 3.4.0. If you run into the following message

  Persistent class store will be disabled: you have a wrong version of pcs
  installed. Remove old pcs files?

say "Yes" and the PCS files will be regenerated.

2. Viewing manpages and documentation in KDevelop
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to be able to view manpages and documentation within KDevelop,
you need to install the 'kdebase-kio' plugins package.
