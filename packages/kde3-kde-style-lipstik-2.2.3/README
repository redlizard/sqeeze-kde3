#CREDITS
This is based on the work of Sandro Giessl <ceebx@users.sourceforge.net> and 
the author of kerastik from which I ripped the automake,configure,etc. 
Im not quite sure yet but the author of kerastik seems to be "intirruphay".
Please "intirruphay" tell me more so I can credit you for your work.

#WHY?
Well, I first distributed this "hack" on kde-look.org as a replacement for plastik, but
some people convinced me to release it as a fully separated package.

#WHY??
Plastik looks good, I just wanted something different for Christmas.

#NO, REALLY, WHY???
I want peace in the world, and this is how Im gonna achieve this.

#HOW DO I INSTALL THIS STYLE?
PLEASE LOOK AT THE FILE CALLED "INSTALL" ...

Have fun!
