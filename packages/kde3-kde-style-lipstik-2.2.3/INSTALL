----- First of all:

If possible, and available, try a package built specifically for your 
distribution...


----- Building from sources:

First make sure that you have both the QT and KDE development headers 
installed. (qt and kdelibs devel)

Then unpack the sources somewhere you have writing rights.

In a terminal (konsole, xterm, eterm, etc.), type :

    ./configure

    make

    (Then, as root):
    make install

--

If any of these steps fail, do:
    
    make -f Makefile.dist

It may help you build it. If it still fails, mail me.


----- Bad configure = build failure...

You might need to give 'configure' the path to your kde
installation. eg: /usr, /opt/kde.

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/kde

--

You can find your KDE base directory by typing kde-config --prefix

--

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----- Debian notes: 

You may need to append this to the configure line:
    --prefix=/usr 

And maybe this one:
    --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3


----- Mandrake/Mandriva notes:

Mandrake 10.0 uses KDE 3.2. I never tested lipstik against KDE 3.2 but it "should" work with
some tweaking (see Debian notes).
I dont have Mandrake around so I cant give more specific help for now, stay tuned.

Mandriva (Mandrake's new name) is using more recent KDE releases. Lipstik should work
out of the box there.


----- moc troubles???

Some people have reported that building fails with errors related to .moc files.
 eg:
    lipstikconf.cpp:479:27: lipstikconf.moc: No such file or directory

If this happens to you, dont panic.
In the source dir, there are style and style/config subdirs:
 
 In the style dir do:
    moc -o lipstik.moc lipstik.h

 And then in the style/config subdir do
    moc -o lipstikconf.moc lipstikconf.h

Then run make again, it should work.


----- Lipstik's build system sucks...

It should suck less now... maybe...
