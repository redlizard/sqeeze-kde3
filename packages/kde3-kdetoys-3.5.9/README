Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com
to get the latest copy of Qt 3.3.x version.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.

Please direct any bug reports to our bug list by visiting
http://bugs.kde.org.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
