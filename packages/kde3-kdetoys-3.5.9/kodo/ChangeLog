                         accuracy. Removed unneccesary label updates.
 19 Apr 1995 mhg V2.0    Removed OpenVMS-specific AST code in favor of
                         XtAppAddTimeout. (Works a lot better now, too.)

                         to allow for "continuous" display update while
                         mouse is in motion.
 27 Oct 1995 mhg V2.1    Final cleanup for this version and public
                         release.

 18 May 1998 asn V3.0    Broke the code in all sorts of ways to turn
                         the mild-mannered Motif version into a
                         modern KDE program.  Code turned into C++,
                         all Xm references were removed, and VMS
                         support was dumped!

 22 Aug 1998 asn V3.1    Minor updates to make it compile more
                         gracefully on modern C++ compilers,
                         and updated things to KDE 1.0 specs.
                         Added a proper About Box.

 16 May 2001 gb  V3.2    Code cleanups, more KDE 2.0 compatible.
