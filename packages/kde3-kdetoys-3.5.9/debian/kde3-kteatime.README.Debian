Non-KDE Users:

  Please note that KTeaTime is written explicitly for KDE.  If you are
  using a non-KDE window manager or desktop environment then it is quite
  possible that KTeaTime will not work on your system.

  This application provides documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
  Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
  web browser, see the package kdetoys-doc-html.
