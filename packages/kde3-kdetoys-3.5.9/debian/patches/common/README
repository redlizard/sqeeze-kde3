Common patches across KDE Debian packages
=========================================

  These directory should contain patches to the admin/ subdir of KDE
  modules that are meant to be applied to all packaged modules. As the
  admin/ subdir is shared across modules (and so, it's identical for all
  modules at a certain version), I think it makes sense to have these
  patches in a central location, and update them here.

  The script update.sh takes care of automatically updating the patches
  that update autotools and libtool. You need to pass the location of an
  admin/ directory as the first argument.
