<title>Using &kworldclock;</title>

<sect1><title>The main display</title>
<para>
When you start &kworldclock;, you will see a small window appear, as
shown below.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Here's a screenshot of &kworldclock;</screeninfo>
	<mediaobject>

	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>

	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
The light section (which in the screenshot above covers Antartica,
Australia, eastern and southern Africa and most of Asia; plus the
Indian Ocean and the western part of the Pacific Ocean) shows the area
that is currently experiencing daylight, while the darker section
(which in the screenshot above covers western Europe, North and South
America, and the Arctic zone) shows the area that is currently
experiencing night. The border between the dark and light section
is the area that is experiencing morning or evening twilight.
</para>

<para>
Each small black square indicates a city or population centre.  If you
locate the mouse over (or near) one of the black squares, you will see
the date and time that is current for that location.  In the
screenshot above, the tiny island of Pitcairn is shown.
</para>

<para>
You may find it more convenient to expand the window, so that there is
more space between the various squares. Remember that you can expand the window by
either clicking on the maximise button (second button from the right in the
top right hand corner) or by using the mouse to drag the corner of the
main window. An expanded window, with Melbourne (Australia) now
selected, is shown below.
</para>

<sect1 id="kworldclock-clocks"><title>Configuring &kworldclock; with timezone clocks</title>

<para>
If you need to know the time in a number of areas around the world, it
may be useful to have &kworldclock; show the applicable times. An
example of how this can look is shown below.
</para>

<para>

</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
Note the clocks for Perth, Sydney and Berlin at the bottom of the main
&kworldclock; window. 
</para>

<para>
These clocks are added by using the right mouse button, and selecting
the <guilabel>Clock</guilabel> entry, as shown below.
</para>

<para>

</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
This will allow access to the <guilabel>Add...</guilabel> selection,
which will bring up a dialog box as shown below. The contents of the
dialog box are determined from the closest city to the mouse cursor
when you make the selection.
</para>

</screenshot>
</para>


<para>
You can now make an appropriate selection for the clock label and the
timezone. Note that you can change the label to whatever is
appropriate, and the timezone as required. An example, for the small
Australian town of Quairading, is shown below.
</para>

<para>

	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
When you select OK, the clock entry is added to those at the bottom of
the main window. A screenshot, with the extra entry for Quairading, is
shown below.
</para>

<para>

	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>Screenshot showing Quairading clock.</phrase> 
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
You might notice that Perth and Quairading are now showing the same
information (since they are in the same timezone). In this case, the
Perth entry is no longer required, so it can be removed. This can be
done by again using the right mouse button on the clock display, and selecting
the <guilabel>Remove</guilabel> item.
</para>

<para>
You can also edit entries by using the <guilabel>Edit...</guilabel>
entry on right mouse button menu, which may be useful for making
minor changes.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="kworldclock-flags"><title>Adding Flags to the &kworldclock; display</title>

<para>
As shown in the screenshot below, you can add flags to places on the
map (in this case, Fremantle near Perth, Western Australia; near
Moscow in Russia; and the Azores in the mid-Atlantic). These flags
don't affect any other functionality - they just allows you to quickly
locate places of interest.
</para>

<para>

	  <textobject>
	    <phrase>Screenshot showing expanded window, with three flags.</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
You add flags by locating the mouse at the point where you want to
appear, and using the right mouse button to select the the
<guilabel>Flags...</guilabel> entry. You can select one of the three
pre-defined flag colours (that is, <guilabel>Add Red</guilabel>,
<guilabel>Add Green</guilabel> or <guilabel>Add Blue</guilabel>), or
you can select a custom colour.
</para>

<para>
You use the same menu action to remove just one flag (whichever one is
closest to the mouse when you make the <guilabel>Remove
Flag</guilabel> selection; or to remove all the flags, using the
<guilabel>Remove All Flags</guilabel>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="kworldclock-display"><title>Changing the &kworldclock; display</title>

<para>
In addition to the additional clocks and flags, there are other minor
variations you can make to the main &kworldclock; display, such as not
showing the flags, not showing the small black city squares, and not
showing the day/night areas. Each of these is selected using the right
mouse button menu.
</para>

<para>
To enable and disable the display of the day / night sections, you use
the right mouse button, and select the <guilabel>Show
Daylight</guilabel> item from the menu. Each time you select it, the
selection will be toggled. When showing day and night is enabled
(normal mode on first startup), there will be a small check mark
(tick symbol) next to the <guilabel>Show Daylight</guilabel>. An
example of the menu item (with day / night not enabled, hence no check
mark) is shown below.
</para>

<para>
To enable and disable the display of the small black city squares, you use
the right mouse button, and select the <guilabel>Show
Cities</guilabel> item from the menu. Each time you select it, the
selection will be toggled. When showing cities is enabled
(normal mode on first startup), there will be a small check mark
(tick symbol) next to the <guilabel>Show Cities</guilabel>. An
example of the menu item (with city display enabled, hence a check
mark) is shown below.

selection will be toggled. When showing flags is enabled
(normal mode on first startup), there will be a small check mark

</para>

<para>
After reconfiguring &kworldclock;, you may wish to save your
settings. This is done using the right mouse button, and selecting the
<guilabel>Save Settings</guilabel> option.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="kworldclock-maps"><title>Selecting alternative maps</title>
<para>
In addition to the normal surface depth map, you can add additional
maps, which can be selected using the <guilabel>Map Theme</guilabel>
item from the right mouse button menu. &kworldclock; comes with a
single map, which provides surface depth (relief). Additional maps can be obtained from 
<ulink url="http://www.radcyberzine.com/xglobe">http://www.radcyberzine.com/xglobe</ulink>.
Maps need to be appropriately installed - typically into
<filename>share/apps/kworldclock/maps</filename> under the main &kde;
directory. Consult your system administrator for assistance in doing
this, if required.
</para>

<para>
If you want to use your own map, you should make sure
that Greenwich is exactly in the middle of the map, and provide an
appropriate desktop file.
</para>

<chapter id="developers">
<title>Developer's Guide to &kworldclock;</title>

<para>
The most common requirement for development of &kworldclock; is to add
additional cities to the map. The cities are determined by a file
named <filename>zone.tab</filename>, which is located under
<filename>share/apps/kworldclock</filename> under the main &kde;
directory.
</para>

<para>
To add an additional city, you need to know the latitude and
longitude, and also the applicable time zone information. There is
additional information on the exact format required in the
<filename>zone.tab</filename> file.
