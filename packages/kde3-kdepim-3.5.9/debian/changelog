kdepim (4:3.5.5.dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This release is dedicated to Rembrandt van Rijn for his fast response
    fixing KPilot. Many thanks.

  +++ Changes by Sune Vuorela:

  * Added 18_optimize_splitAddressInternal.diff to fix lock up on weird
    headers. It is actually a performance tweak, as it normally continues
    after 10-15 minutes of non-responding state. Fix by Johannes Schaub. It
    has a nice side effect to be a general performance boost. (Closes: #398073)
  * Fixed default value for external browser in akregator. (Patch 21) (Closes: #375233)
  * Added more suggests of spamfilters to kmail. (Closes: #376250)
  * Added suggests of gnokii to kontact. (Closes: #377356)
  * Fixed manpage of akregator to not talk about korganizer. Thanks to Kenny
    Duffus.
  * Do not build against bluetooth on !linux. (Closes: #399061)
  * Slowly starting dependency chain on -dbg packages. Adding kdelibs-dbg to
    kdepim-dbg depends.
  * Fixed romanian debconf template. (Closes: #397827)
  * Do not chmod stuff in kpilot if it is not there (in case of udev).
    (Closes: #378696)
  * Added gigantic patch in order to make KPilot works with pilot-link 0.12.0 (patch 25).
    (Closes: #394534)
    + The new patch does not build all conduits.
    + kpilot.install modified because of this.
    + parts of the branch pull removed as it is included in the kpilot diff.

kdepim (4:3.5.5.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve KOrganizer's description, from Filipus Klutiero.
    (Closes: #392468)
  * Remove non-free IETF docs from the source tarball.
    Closes: #395082.
    + Urgency medium for the RC bug fix.
    + Stop using tarball.mk, since the only reason for that in the first
      place was to get the source package to consist of a file verifiable
      using upstream md5sums.  But since we have to repackage now anyway,
      there's no point to doing this any more.
    + New patch 16_kde_modulename.diff so that admin/cvs.sh finds the
      right package name.
  * Update from SVN branch, revision 600288, except for the changes to
    libkmime, which break binary compatibility, and the changes to kalarm,
    which I deem to be too invasive this close to a release.
    + Absorbs 15_kdepim_debug.diff.
    + Fixes a problem with korganizer.desktop causing it not to start.
      Closes: #395940, #395286, #394309.

kdepim (4:3.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    + Fixes korganizer: reminder daemon leaks memory. (Closes: #357043)

  +++ Changes by Daniel Schepler:
  
  * Disable asking questions in the kmail d-imap debugging patch, since
    MadCoder has not been able to trigger mail loss answering yes to
    all questions.
  * Add new directory for icon files to libkdepim1a.install.
  * Urgency medium for the RC bug fixes.

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Improve konsolekalendar's description. (Closes: #384941)

  * Add alpha and ppc64 to the problematic arch list, thus disabling
    --enable-final and allowing kdepim to build. (Closes: #387419, #388014)

  * Add Romanian debconf translation, thanks to Stan Ioan-Eugen.
    (Closes: #387589)

  +++ Changes by Pierre Habouzit:

  * Modify the kdepim d-imap debugging patch to be less verbose and intrusive,
    but keep the rest of the patch, with its slightly safer file handling. No
    reports of d-imap data loss have surfaced with the recent code, and
    testing suggests that the problem is fixed.

kdepim (4:3.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

   +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Branch pull to revision 577416, minus the akregator feeddetector
    changes which don't build.

  * Added kdepim extra debug information from KDE bug #104956. Users of
    d-imap will have to put up with extra dialogs, but this is hopefully
    only until the d-imap data loss issues are worked out (some work on
    that problem is in this upload, but it hasn't been confirmed to fix
    the problem).

  * Removed autotools-dev from the Build-Depends; automake1.9 depends on it.

   +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Packaging sync with the rest of the team KDE packages. Update
    package descriptions, sync debian-qt-kde.mk and other CDBS
    stuff (should help building on slow architectures). Also fixes a
    package description typo. (Closes: #364138)

  * Remove patch that disabled --enable-final for kmail, now that we disable
    it globally on m68k and arm. We'll see if the other architectures can
    truly cope.

  * Change dependencies on kdepim-kio-plugins or kdebase-kio-plugins to
    dependencies on both; simple, and should prevent user error.
    (Closes: #327821)

  * Make kaddressbook suggest kdebase-kio-plugins for LDAP support.
    (Closes: #337527)

  * Add Spanish debconf translation. (Closes: #383360)

  * Move libemailfunctions/idmapper.h from kdepim-dev to libkcal2-dev.
    kdepim-dev depends on libkcal2-dev, so this shouldn't cause any problems.
    Replaces have been added. (Closes: #342452)

  * Fix small bug in kmail_clamav.sh script. (Closes: #354185)

  * Install ktnef MIME entries to /etc/mailcap. (Closes: #316373)

  * Rename libmimelib1c2 to libmimelib1c2a due to C++ allocator changes.

    + Link against libkdefakes_pic.a instead of -lkdefakes to
      eliminate mimelib's dependency on kdelibs.

      lurker.  Also split out libkmime2 from this package while I'm
      at it so that lurker users don't have to install kdelibs4 --
      at least, they won't have to once I can link libkdefakes statically
      into mimelib (see bug #326113).
  * Add Vietnamese debconf translation.  Closes: #312159.
  * Remove 10_korganizer_makefile.diff, which has been applied in
    upstream SVN and thus is included in the kdepim_branch patch.
  * Remove obsolete Conflicts and Replaces on packages not in sarge.
  * Fix command synopsis in kabc2mutt manpage.  Closes: #324958.

    on this package up until now.

    libmimelib1a package, and libkpgp, which is now in the libkleopatra0a
    package.

    on it.
    + Also split libktnef1-dev from kdepim-dev.

    /usr/share/man/sh/man1.

kdepim (4:3.3.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Set urgency to medium to hopefully get these changes into sarge.
  * Add Recommends on procmail to kmail, which is needed for fetching
    mbox mail.
  * Tighten libtool build dependency.  This closes half of #285882,
    while the other half is really a kdelibs issue.
  * Include the GFDL in debian/copyright, since the handbooks are
    licensed under it.
  * Update the list of licenses.

kdepim (4:3.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium due to fix for buildd issues.
  * Updates from KDE_3_3_BRANCH.
  * Stop building static libraries to make buildd's happy (or at least
    happier).  They were pretty useless anyway without static versions
    of Qt or kdelibs.  Closes: #281955.
  * Update kleopatra dependencies for current experimental gnupg2/gpgsm
    packages.  Closes: #274611, #280759.
  * Drop cryptplug from kmail's dependencies, since it's no longer used.
    Closes: #274612.
  * Add blurb about kdepim-kio-plugins and kdebase-kio-plugins
    dependencies to kmail's description, due to the number of people who
    somehow manage to install kmail without even noticing the Recommends
    on these packages, then complain that things don't work.
    Closes: #274657.

    other kdepim-specific patches to 2?_*.diff.

    from messing up the static libraries.
    + debian/rules: Reenable --enable-final.
  * kde.mk: Add calls to dh_desktop.
    + debian/control: Build-Depends on debhelper (>= 4.2.21) to ensure
      dh_desktop is available.
  * Correct URL in kleopatra description.  Closes: #275522.
  * Bump shlibs version to require current version.  Closes: #275211.
  * Package name change: libmimelib1 -> libmimelib1a, because of
    missing DwHeaders::AllFieldBodiesAsString(DwString const&) (at least)
    since version 4:3.2.3-1.  Closes: #276607.
  * Package name change: libkleopatra0 -> libkleopatra0a, because of
    missing symbols since last version:
    + Kleo::Job::showErrorDialog(QWidget*) const
    + Kleo::KeyListView::parentFor(QCString const&) const
    + Kleo::KeyListView::refillFingerprintDictionary()
    + Kleo::QGpgMEEncryptJob::showErrorDialog(QWidget*) const
    + Kleo::QGpgMESignEncryptJob::showErrorDialog(QWidget*) const
    + Kleo::QGpgMESignJob::showErrorDialog(QWidget*) const
    + Kleo::KeyListViewItem::~KeyListViewItem().

    To KDE upstream maintainers: every time you break binary compatibility
    like this in a public library, I'm going to have to increase the
    library "subversion" in the package name, which will delay packages
    entering sid.  Please keep this in mind before making such changes, if
    the rule that non-backward-compatible changes require a new SONAME
    carries no weight with you.
