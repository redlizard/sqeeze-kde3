Reporting a kmail crash
---------------------------

When you report a kmail crash, it is important to provide:
 * the exact steps to reproduce the crash
 * a useful backtrace of the crash

To produce a useful backtrace, you must have qt-x11-free-dbg, kdelibs-dbg,
and kdepim-dbg installed. A backtrace full of "(no debugging symbols
found)" is useless.

A bug that is not reproducible, or that lacks the necessary backtrace, will
be discarded.
