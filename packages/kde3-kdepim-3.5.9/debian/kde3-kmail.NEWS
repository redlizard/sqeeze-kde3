kdepim (4:3.5.5.dfsg.1-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * KMail's handling of IMAP namespaces changed in KDE 3.5.  You used to be
    able to set a prefix for your mailboxes (most commonly INBOX. for
    courier-imap and cyrus-imapd servers) that would tell KMail where to look
    for mail folders.  In KDE 3.5, KMail now handles both personal and shared
    namespaces.  It no longer strips the namespace from the beginning of the
    folder path, though, so some users will see that all of their folders are
    now subfolders of the inbox.

    Due to this change, KMail may get confused when it starts after upgrading
    and crash.  We don't have a solution to the bug at this time, but there is
    a workaround that doesn't result in any dataloss.

    The folder $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kmail/imap/ holds cached copies of all
    the mail headers in your imap account.  Deleting everything in this folder
    (rm -rf ~/.kde/share/apps/kmail/imap/*) allows KMail to startup.  KMail
    will need to redownload all the mail headers, but it would need to do so
    anyway since it thinks the mail folders appearing under the inbox are
    different folders.

    In some cases even this workaround has not been enough.  If KMail still
    behaves strangely for you after doing this, you may need to move KMail's
    configuration file out of the way in addition to removing its IMAP cache.
    To do this, "mv ~/.kde/share/config/kmailrc
    ~/.kde/share/config/kmailrc.bak".  After doing this, KMail should behave
    better, but you will need to reconfigure all of your accounts.
