This package shall help a better integration of KDE/Linux into a Windows environment
by providing tools to work with Windows .lnk files

This package contains 2 tools:

- a KFile plugin, kfile_lnk, which gives metadata information for a .lnk file (where does it point to)

- a small tool, lnkforward, to start an associated application for which the path is in a .lnk file
  (e.g. when you double-click a file in konqueror)

The .lnk file is registered as MIME type application/x-win-lnk

If you have a dual-boot machine, and you have your Windows partition(s) mounted,
then you should adapt where konqi can find the corresponding C:, D: or other drives.
For this you have to adapt the used commandline arguments for lnkforward, which you
can do in konqis file-associations for the MIME type application/x-win-lnk

The lnkforward tool shall get a commandline option like this:

-map C=/mnt/winC -map D=/mnt/winD

NOTE: both tools work with .lnk files which are either readable via the local filesystem
(smbfs mounted filesystems) or also via URLs on the network, e.g. smb://something

Have fun.

Martin
