*** TODO for the Lyrics plugin 
    any contribution is welcomed! ***

- Save scroll position (in a per search engine basis, probably)
  - To account for tables (like in SM)
- Save Lyrics to file:
  - As a URL
  - As a HTML file
  - As Selected text
- Automatically searchs at all the places 
  (configurable "no result" regexp)
- Ideas for the interface:
    - Save as (URL|HTML|SELECTED TEXT)
    - Auto save songs (at ~ or global)
    - Remove (.*) ie, stuff like (live), (cover), etc
      - Remove non alphabetic stuff
- Max search size
