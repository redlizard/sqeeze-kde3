	* fix: use a local copy of KFileItem taken from list view
	  Can't trust KDirOperator not to destruct it.

2003-02-26  Eray Ozkural (exa) <erayo@cs.bilkent.edu.tr>
	* implement shuffle/linear sequencer
	 - use libc random number generator, and init seed with time()
	* implement shuffle/recursive sequencer
	 - use a simple minded selection-randomizer in dir tree
	* add a wrapper for libc random functions

2003-02-24  Eray Ozkural (exa) <erayo@cs.bilkent.edu.tr>
	* implement Linear_Recursive sequencer
	* disable unimplemented play options
	* fix: open debugging early termination in playlist getFirst
	* Recursive_Seq:
	  - code stabilized
	  - greatly simplify traversal code
	  - iterators suck (see DubInfo::past_begin)
	  - restart preorder traversal if finished
	  - add prev_preorder traversal
	  - fix: preorder traversal, there were a quite a few obscure bugs
	  - fix: remove code to skip from basic traversal class
	  - verbose debug logging
	
2003-02-23  Eray Ozkural (exa) <erayo@cs.bilkent.edu.tr>
	* Recursive_Seq:
	  - fix: compare recursion root change too with canonical dirs
	  - fix: avoid reading parent directories. I incidentally had this
	    backwards, reading only parent dirs.
	  - implement preorder traversal (next only)
	  - debugging output
	  - partially fix iteration of dirs and files in recursive sequencer
	  - start writing preorder traversal
	* fix: read config module options
	* fix: show media home on startup / when changed
	* remove obsolete file traversal functions
	* comment out debug output in playlistitem
