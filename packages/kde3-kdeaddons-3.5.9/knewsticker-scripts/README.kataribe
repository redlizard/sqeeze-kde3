Kataribe Readme

Kataribe is a more or less simple script to turn your Mbox into an RSS file,
so that you may display the subject and from in your Knewsticker. This
script uses a set of Perl modules to access the mail box. The standard mail
box format which I assume is the classic UNIX Mbox format. The script is
rather flexible though and if you wish to adjust the script to fit your
mailbox's needs, please be my guest. You can find a list of classes, which
are supported by the module here:
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Mail%3A%3ABox

The following list of modules must be installed in order for this script to
work:

Data::Dumper;
Date::Format;
Mail::Box;
Mail::Box::Manager;
MIME::Words

Make sure, that you set the $limit variable in the top section of the
script. Parsing a Mbox file is not highly efficient and parsing a huge Mbox
file over and over can be very time consuming. This might cause the script
to time out and not report any data back to KNewsticker. By default only the
_newest_ ten messages are read and displayed as RSS.

This script tries to be smart about the From header, yet might not always
guess right. The script assumes to find a from in the form of:

A name <a@email.de>

It will try to display the A name part in Knewsticker along with the subject
of the mail messages. If the script cannot find a name, it will try to use
the email address instead.

I realize, that there are still several issues, which could be adressed and
the script surely is not 100% feature complete, but it is operational for
those, who wish to have a quick overview about the new mail, which might
have been dumped into their local account using fetchmail or any other
delivering service.

This IS a work in progress, it has been tested by the author but not by any
other, so please make sure to do so and report back to bio@gmx.de. Thank
you.
