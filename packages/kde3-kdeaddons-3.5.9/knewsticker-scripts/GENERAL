All scripts surrendered to the knewsticker scripts section which are
distributed WITH KDE are subject to the licensing restrictions of the KDE
project. Should you use any of those scripts in conjuction with any KDE
product you are also subject to their licensing. If the script is used
without a KDE affiliation , if not other stated within the script, or if no
co author is present, those scripts are believed to be in the public domain.

Please ensure, that you implement proper error handling within your scripts.
The error handling is important for those, who might be using your script,
but have no real understanding of the underlying structure. Since
Knewsticker is a graphical application it relies on the error codes it gets
from your script to display proper error messages to the end user.

The current set of error messages and how to use them can be found in the
documenation. You can find the documentation at:
http://spoon.pkl.net/~backpane/knews/

If you have questions concerning the precommands or if you want to have
certain features implemented into Knewsticker, please contact the
Knewsticker precommand scripts maintainer at dlanx@kde.org, who will talk to
the Knewsticker author for you, or contact him directly at raabe@kde.org.

Thank you.
