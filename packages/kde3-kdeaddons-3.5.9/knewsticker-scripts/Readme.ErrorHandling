Error Handling for Knewsticker Pre commands

Error handling might not be a prerequisite for writing Knewsticker scripts,
yet it would be nice if you tried to introduce some comprehensive error
handling in your scripts. Knewsticker is a graphical application and as such
the user is not able to read any error output your program might produce.
Knewsticker knows a variety of error codes and each is handled in a
different way. You may look those codes up in the table provided.

Please make sure to return those error codes properly for the development
language you are trying to use. If you are trying to use Perl, please make
sure you understand an have read the top most part of the error handling
document. It will explain to you, how it is fairly easy to catch errors and
report them back to Knewsticker.

If you are still unsure how to do it on a system level, simply implement
your own error handling and make sure, that your return codes match the
event(s) described in the error handling document you will find in CVS as
well.
