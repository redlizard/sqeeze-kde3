This Readme is meant to describe how you should go about using the
Stockticker to RSS script. Please keep in mind, that all software retrieved
from CVS is in a constant change; your script might work now, but it might
not work a moment later.

You need to customize each executed script to fit your needs, yet before you
can do so, you must be sure, that the version of perl you are running is
providing all the necessary modules for this script to function. You need to
have the following module(s) installed:

Finance::Quote

If you are not sure wheter those are installed, simply execute the script at
the command line and watch for possible errors. Right now the script has no
error handling what so ever, which might be corrected in future versions.
You can either go and retrieve the modules from www.cpan.org and install
them by hand or run the following command as root, while you are connected
to the Internet:

perl -MCPAN -e "install module::name"

Executing this command at the prompt will automatically download and install
the requested module, eventual dependencies will be resolved automatically.

Once you have installed all the necessary tools, you can start customizing
your script, this means, that you should open it with your favourite editor
and read the comments above each variable you must set carefully. Most
scripts are commented rather precisely, as it is the case with this one.

Once you are sure you have set all the variables as requested in the scripts
upper part, you may now store it anywhere on your hard disk. Make sure you
have read knewstickers help on executing pre commands.

Enjoy this script and READ the commentary within it..
