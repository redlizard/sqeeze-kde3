This file is roughly based on your systems errno.h.
Many perl errors can be exported as errors defined in errno.h by doing the
 following:
use Errno qw(EINTR EIO :POSIX);
or simply use Errno.

The semantics of this file are as follows:
 A numerical error code followed by a human readable upper case short definition, which is followed by an 
explanation of the actual error code. 
We assume, that the interpreter you use returns an
error code of 1 upon failing to execute your script and an error code of 0 if
the execution is successful. This does NOT include any data passed from 
the script or any errors which might occur during runtime, it is simply a 
way for us to determine wheter your script started at all and if any more 
output should be expected.
Some of the errors described below can be categorized, those categories range
from warning over critical to fatal.
An error which would terminate your script and therefore close the running
process, would be considered as fatal. 
An error which would prevent your script from sending valid output, yet 
not terminate its process would be considered as critical. Any other 
error is considered as warning. A warning is always
OPTIONAL, critical errors and fatal errors MUST be implemented

Depending on which script language or programming language you use it is
up to you, to determine wheter an error is fatal, critical or just a warning,
some suggestions have been made in the list below.
Generic and system error section:
0       NOERR           No error has been detected
1       EPERM           The operation is not permitted by the executing program.
                                Which means, that some fatal error occurred and
                                your script could not even be started.
2       ENOENT          A file or directory your script wanted to read or write
                                could not be found and the scripts operation was
                                hampered by that.
5       EIO                     There has been an error while your script
                                attempted to read or write data
7       E2BIG                 If your scripts accepts arguments at the command
                                line, this error means, that too many arguments
                                were entered. This error code is not in 
				effect yet.
8       ENOEXEC         If your script relies on system level programs and that
                                        program could not be executed, use this
                                        error code to report that to
                                        knewsticker. This is an informational
                                        error code and not necessarily a fatal
                                        one
13      EACCESS            permission to a resource or file has been denied to
                                        your script, which does not allow it to
                                        properly function, this error is fatal
                                        and should be followed at once by
                                        and exit code of 1
19      ENODEV               A device you are trying to write to is not
                                        available, as above this error code is
                                        fatal, it should be followed by an exit
                                        code of 1 to terminate your scripts
                                        operation.
28      ENOSPC              There is no more space left on the device you are
                                        trying to write a temporary file to.
30      EROFS                 You are trying to write a temporary file to an
                                        read only file system
38      ENOSYS               Your script tried to call a function which was not
                                        implemented or it is trying to access an
                                        external resource which does not exist.
                                        You can also use this error code when
                                        you are writing a perl script and the
                                        modules functions you are trying to
                                        access is not present.
61      ENODATA             Your script has not been able to retrieve any data.
                                        Thus no XML can be returned. This error
                                        is critical, yet not necessarily fatal.
---------------------------------------------------------
Network related errors.
64      ENONET               The machine you are using is not connected to a
                                        network. This error is fatal
71      EPROTO              Your script tried to access a protocol which is not
                                        implemented. This would mean, that you
                                        are trying to use SNMP on a system that
                                        does not understand it
89       EDESTADDRREQ  Your script requires for the user to enter a destination
                                                address to retrieve data from.
                                                This error is used when that has
                                                not been done. It is
                                                informational yet fatal
                                                to the script
94      ESOCKTNOSUPPORT Your script is trying to use a socket type not supported
                                                        by the system, for
                                                        example trying to open a
                                                        unix socket of a
                                                        system where this is not
                                                        supported
101 ENETUNREACH                 The network you are trying to access is
                                          unreachable
102 ENETRESET           The network you were trying to access dropped the
                                            connection with a reset
104 ECONNRESET          The connection you had has been reset by your peer
110 ETIMEDOUT           The connection you were trying to establish timed out
111 ECONNREFUSED  The connection you were trying to established has been refused
112 EHOSTDOWN           The host you are trying to reach is down
113 EHOSTUNREACH      The host you are trying to reach is unreachable, no route
                                                to host
Please NOTE that above error codes ONLY correspond to the error numbers defined
on Linux i386 machines if you wish to use the Perl method mentioned.
The error codes which are mentioned above are _reserved_ for newsticker internal
use and have not necessarily anything to do with the error codes returned by
your system.

----------------
Since we are possibly dealing often with HTTP error codes this is a specialized
section you may use to return errors based on that protocol.
These error codes correspond to the actual HTTP error codes, thus enabling 
you to handle them easier when passing them on to Knewsticker.
Client errors:
400 EBADREQ             Bad Request. Your script sent a bad request, not
                                        understood by the server, which is
                                        reporting this back to you.
401 ENOAUTH             No authorization has been issued for an area that needs
                                        some form of authorization before it can
                                        be accessed
402 EMUSTPAY            You cannot access the data without paying for it, this
                                        is not a bogus error, it is defined as
                                        such in the http protocol
403 EFORBIDDEN          You are forbidden to access the source you requested
404 ENOTFOUND           The data you tried to access could not be found.
408 ETIMEOUT                Your HTTP request timed out, this is an error which
                                        reflects timeouts for the HTTP protocol
                                        ONLY. Generic time outs are handled in
                                        the above paragraph
Server errors:
500 ESERVERE            A server error has been encountered.
505 EHTTPNOSUP      The HTTP protocol version you attempted to use was not
                                        understood by the http server or source
                                        you were trying to access
