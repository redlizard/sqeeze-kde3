This Readme is meant to describe how you should go about using the news to
RSS script. Please keep in mind, that all software retrieved from CVS is in
a constant change; your script might work now, but it might not work a
moment later.

Even though the script can handle multiple newsgroups at once, Knewsticker
has not been adjusted to handle such a behavior on its own, therefore please
poll only one newsgroup per executed script.

You need to customize each executed script to fit your needs, yet before you
can do so, you must be sure, that the version of perl you are running is
providing all the necessary modules for this script to function. You need to
have the following modules installed:

News::NNTPClient;
MIME::Words

If you are not sure wheter those are installed, simply execute the script at
the command line and watch for possible errors. Right now the script has no
error handling whatsoever, which might be corrected in future versions. You
can either go and retrieve the modules from www.cpan.org and install them by
hand or run the following command as root, while you are connected to the
Internet:

perl -MCPAN -e "install module::name"

Executing this command at the prompt will automatically download and install
the requested module, eventual dependencies will be resolved automatically.

Once you have installed all the necessary tools, you can start customizing
your script, this means, that you should open it with your favourite editor
and read the comments above each variable you must set carefully.

Most scripts are commented rather precisely, as it is the case with this
one. Of course you may set which nntp host we are connecting to within the
script, but if you have a host set in /etc/nntpserver the script will ALWAYS
default to that server, this has been implemented for systems, where the
administrator might not wish you to use a different nntp server. Of course
it can be evaded, but we urge you to be polite and use what is offered to
you by the system.

Once you are sure you have set all the variables as requested in the scripts
upper part, you may now store it anywhere on your hard disk. Make sure you
have read knewstickers help on executing pre commands.

Enjoy this script.
