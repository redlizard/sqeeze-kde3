* port it to more platforms (what about remote monitoring?)

* include some sort of support for SMP status (smaller bars?); also for
  multiple swap partitions/files?

* make it more flexible (plug-in concept?)

* improve documentation (add images?), better internationalisation

* add help button in configuration dialog

* have some way of attaching watchdogs (e.g. if %idle > 90 for more than
  10 seconds, do this or that (or pop up a dialog))
