========================================================================== 


KTimemon 0.3a
-------------

KTimemon is a small but nifty system monitor, which can display information
about CPU and memory/swap usage as well as ongoing paging/swapping and
context switch activity. It is well integrated in KDE and can be
configured graphically. For more information, see the associated
documentation (before installation it can be found in ktimemon/doc/*.html)

KTimemon works on Linux using the /proc filesystem, on Solaris using the
kstat interface, and on Digital Unix (formerly known as DEC/OSF1) using
the table() system call interface. If you can help me to port it to other
platforms, please drop me a note!

While I was able to test the system interface on Solaris and DEC/OSF1 in
isolation, I could not test the whole application for lack of KDE on the
machines I have access to. Hence I have no idea whether this thing
actually compiles, let alone works on these platforms. The machines I tested
were running DEC/OSF V4.0 and Solaris 2.5.1 respectively. If you get it to
work (or not) on such a system, please let me know!


Noteworthy changes from version 0.2:
- Port to DEC/OSF1 and Solaris
- Configurable mouse bindings
- Slight rearrangement of memory information
- Bars can be displayed vertically
- Improved (actually working) configuration interface
- Fixed a few bugs and doubtlessly introduced some more

Version 0.3a has only minor improvements over 0.3:
- New tooltips with numeric information about system load
- Translation fixes

Note that some of the configuration entry names have changed from version
0.2 to 0.3, so you may want to delete your current configuration in 
$(HOME)/.kde/share/config/ktimemonrc and start with a fresh installation
if you are upgrading from 0.2
