Konqsidebarnews is based on the rss DCOP service in
kdenetwork/dcoprss. So you most likely you want to
install it before using the sidebar applet.



TODO
====

- better handling of starting up rssservice

- less crashes (check for stupid user input, etc...)

- cleanly recover from a crashing dcop service

- documentation

- accessibility aware UI

- integration with kdenetwork/knewsticker
