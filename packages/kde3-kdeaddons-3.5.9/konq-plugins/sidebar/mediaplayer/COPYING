There are some licenses involved in this small plugin:
1) konqsidebarplugin.h: LGPL
2) player.*, engine.* are taken from noatun/kaboodle/arts and have there own licenes.
	Look in these projects for their licenses (At the time I write this I think they are licencesed under the BSD 
	license)

3) All other files are copyrighted under the GPL
