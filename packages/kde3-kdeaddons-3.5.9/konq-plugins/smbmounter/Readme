This directory existed until kde 3.3, if you're interested to revive it, you
can get it back from cvs. It has been removed because the smbro-ioslave has also
been removed, and this plugin doesn't work without it.

This plugin for konqy works together with the smbro ioslave.
It uses the special() function of the smbro ioslave to mount and unmount smb
shares. This is done by the ioslave by executing smbmount and smbumount.
Therefor both have to be installed suid root. 
If you consider this a security risk, don't use this plugin.
Move with konqy into a smb share (e.g. smb://host/my_files) and then select
Tools->smbmount current share. The share "my_files" will be mounted under
"~/smb_network/host/my_files". Once you mounted the share, the menu item
"smbumount current share" becomes active, so that you can unmount it again.

AFAIK smbmount is linux-only, so it won't work on other systems.

If you have suggestions, wishes or find bugs, send me an email.
