KDE Add-On Plugins and Applets for Debian
-----------------------------------------

Package kdeaddons is a metapackage that depends on the full set of add-on
plugins and applets provided with the official release of KDE.

Some packages provide documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
web browser, see the package kdeaddons-doc-html.
