knewsticker-scripts for Debian
------------------------------

This package contains a variety of scripts that provide additional news
sources for KNewsTicker, the KDE news ticker applet for the KDE panel.

Documentation for the individual scripts can be found in directory
/usr/share/doc/knewsticker-scripts/.

The scripts themselves can be found in directory
/usr/share/apps/knewsticker/scripts/.  Some of the scripts may need to be
hand-modified before they can be used, in which case the documentation
and/or the script itself will contain additional instructions.

To specify a script as a news source, open up the KNewsTicker
configuration, select the News Sources tab and add a new source.  The
source file should be the script you wish to use and the checkbox for
"The file is a program" should be checked.
