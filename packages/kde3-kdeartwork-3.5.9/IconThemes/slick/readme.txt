The Slick icon theme.

----------------------------------------
Credit where credit is due

The cdrom icons are not 100% original. the disc part of the image while modified was created by someone else.
I dont know who did them originally but credit partly goes to you.
The Gimp icon is care of Tigert.  Various other things are modified icons from Noia and Crystal.
