-> What is it ?

iKons is a high color icon theme for KDE. It features 16x16, 22x22, 32x32, 48x48
and 64x64 icons with full support for transparency (alpha blending).

-> Requirements

KDE 2.0 or more.

-> Installation

 1) Open the KDE-Menu an start the Control Center
 2) Click on "Look and Feel" and "Icons"
 3) Browse to the location of the new icon theme tar.gz file by clicking the small folder button
 4) Click on "Install New Theme" to add the new icons
 5) Click "Apply"
 6) Have fun! :-)
Note:	after installing , right click on the desktop and click on "line up icons" to finish it out
 		or your icons will act strange and look larger that normal (because iKons is a 48x48
		default icon theme, and KDE uses 32x32 icons as default).

-> Altering the toolbar icons (manual)

 Go to /usr/your_id/.kde/share/icons/iKons/ and change the names of the toolbar icons
 in 16x16/actions and 22x22/actions. There are 4 toolbar icon themes at this time:
 1) iKons (default)
 2) Netscape
 3) QNIX
 4) devel (toolbar icon theme in development)

-> Altering the toolbar icons (with a script) 

 #!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo
  echo "Invoke this script from the iKons directory."
  echo "Give the name of the desired action-icon-theme as parameter:"
  echo "$0 [ netscape | qnix | iKons ]"
  echo
  exit 1
fi

for dir in 16x16 22x22; do
  for icon in `ls $dir/actions/$1*`; do
     new_name=$(dirname $icon)/${icon##*_}
     echo "copying $icon to $new_name"
     cp $icon $new_name
  done
done
