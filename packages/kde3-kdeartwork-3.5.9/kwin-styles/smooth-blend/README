Smooth Blend - a smooth blending of the window background color into the titlebar.

This is my first attempt at a KDE window decoration.
Any comments would be much appreciated and can be sent
to me directly at p0z3r@users.sourceforge.net.

Limitations:
The Frame Width can not be smaller than 2 pixels because it will lose the top gradient.
The buttonsize can not be larger than the Title Height - Frame Width.

Known Problems:
The Shade button doesn't work correctly although the code is there for it.
The Resize button is also afflicted with the same problem.
Support for the Shade button and Resize buttons may or may not be supported depending
upon what I find through the kde mailing lists and other documentation.
