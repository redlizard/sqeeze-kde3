KDE Screensavers for Debian
===========================

This package (kscreensaver) no longer contains the hooks for the standard
xscreensavers.  It only contains the additional screensavers that are
specifically shipped with KDE.

To select and/or configure the standard xscreensavers through the KDE Control
Centre, install the separate package kscreensaver-xsavers.
