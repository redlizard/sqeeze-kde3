KDE Screensavers for Debian
===========================

This package (kscreensaver-xsavers) only contains hooks for the standard
xscreensavers, so that they can be selected and/or configured through
the KDE Control Centre.

For the additional screensavers that are specifically shipped with KDE,
see the separate package kscreensaver.
