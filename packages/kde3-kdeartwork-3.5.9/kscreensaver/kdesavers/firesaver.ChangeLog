	* general : added support for 'per particle' texture with
	smart binding. added 2 textures (explosion light / toxxic)

	* firesaverparticle : finished TurningParticle class. moved
	some code from the header to the cpp.

	* firesaver : added 'Toxic spirals' fireworks, disabled
	supernova in .ui since after 3.3. fixed monochrome<->monotype
	bug.
	
	* firesaverwriter : bugfix on word's color (blinking on start).

2004-05-30  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* this file : renamed Changelog to firesaver.ChangeLog

        * general : moved / renamed files and chaged stuff to get ready
	to be imported into kdeartwork.

	* general : all images are .png, all sounds are .ogg.

2004-02-07  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* firesaver.cpp : implemented trail and alpha on explosions.

	* firesaver : damn dirty bug! reordered projection lines. Looks
	way cooler now. trimmed defaults.
	
	* firesaversetup : config dialog redone from scratch. Now it is
	more usable and ready for translation into different languages.
	Also added many new features.
	
	* firesaver : adapted to setup dialog changes (also embeds the
	setup widget into a KDialogBase). Implemented some new features
	added in the setup dialog.

2004-02-06  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* all : optimized logic and math.. kcachegrind rules.
	
	* firesaverparticle : inheritance test on particle class.
	Implemented a "funny phisics" on the TurningParticle class. This
	will lead to strange fireworks (spirals, fountains... )

2004-01-31  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* all : leak checked and fixed uninitialized values. optimized
	the code for less cpu consumption (reduced 7% over the 19% of
	internal code cpu consumption (the remaining 81% of cpu time is
	spent into GL libraries!!..) seems there's a limit to the code
	optimization!).

	* firesaver : added KDE icons as exploding elements and checked
	the explode logo routine.

	* fw_letters* : added support for overlay writings. cleaned api.
	
	* firesaver.cpp/.h : implemented texture loader. some fixes and
	a major speedup. again more changes to the graphical pipeline.

2004-01-30  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* firesaverparticle.cpp/.h: cleaned a lot; changed the interface.
	It's not completely decoupled from the 'firework' entity yet.
	
	* fw_debris.ogg: added a second sound (used only on logo explosion
	for now).

	* firesaver.cpp: reworked the generation of image logos (new
	default: 64x64 pixel for hi-res).

2004-01-29  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* firesaver.cpp: fix: screen blink. add: particle size not
	dependant from screen size.

	* firesaver.cpp: optimized the rendering core for particles.
	Computation takes now less than half of the time than before.
	Set a capacity of 20000 simultaneous particles; more will be
	dropped (but a progressive 'resize' is done..)
	
	* fw_explode.ogg: converted sound file to ogg format.

	* firesaver.cpp/.h: redone the audio engine (limited by default
	to 4 mixer channels).

	* firesaver.cpp: use the .mp3 sound that is "auto-mixed" by the
	sound system. The old Wav was played sequentially (a boom is heard
	after the previous one terminates). The Ogg format has the same
	problem as the wave one (plus it goes on playing many booms after
	the program is exited).

2004-01-28  Enrico Ros  <eros.kde@email.it>

	* firesaverparticle.cpp: keep a particle independent from the
	'shape' of the firework it belongs to. Added depth (level) of
	explosion (normal particles reach level 1, splitters reach 2).

	* name syntax: converted filenames to match the style of the ones
	in kdeartwork/kscreensaver/kdesavers.

	* merging: merged some file's content to lower the number of files
	before initial import.
