QtCurve KDE, GTK1, and GTK2 style

About
-----

This is a set of widget styles for KDE, GTK1, and GTK2 based apps. The underlying
code is based upon Blue/FreeCurve - however, *extensive* modifications have been
made.


Installation
------------

./configure
make
make install       (MAy need to be root for this step)

For KDE:
   Use KControl, go to the Look'N'Feel section, enter the Style sub-section,
   and choose "QtCurve"

For GTK1:
   Copy
        /usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk/gtkrc
   ...to either
        /etc/gtk/gtkrc           To enable this theme for *all* users
   ...or ~/.gtkrc                To enbale for just yourself.

   Alternatively, edit ~/.gtkrc so that it looks like:
       include "/usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk/gtkrc"

For GTK2:
   Copy
        /usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
   ...to either
        /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc       To enable this theme for *all* users
   ...or ~/.gtkrc-2.0            To enbale for just yourself.

   Alternatively, edit ~/.gtkrc-2.0 so that it looks like:
       include "/usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"


Font Sizes
----------

Using Mandrake 9.0 I came accross a curious situation where a 12pt font was a
different size in a KDE app (which uses Xft to draw fonts), and a GTK1 app (which
uses plain X to draw fonts). I finally tracked this down to the fact that Mandrake
was hard-coding a 90dpi resolution for Xft - wherease standard X defaults to 75dpi.
To remedy this I had to remove the following line:

    Xft.dpi: 90

...from both /etc/X11/Xresources and /etc/X11/xdm/Xresources

Then when the X server was restarted, both Xft and X apps then used the *same*
resolution - resulting in consistency between GTK1, GTK2, and KDE/Qt applications.
(NOTE: You may need to change the used font siszes in KControl/fonts)

If you want to use a higher than 75 dpi resolution, I suggest you edit /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
and set it to someting like (for 100dpi)

:0 local /bin/nice -n -10 /usr/X11R6/bin/X -deferglyphs 16 -dpi 100


...this way *both* Xft and X apps will then use the new resolution!



Fonts
-----

QtCurve reads its font settings from ~/.qt/qtrc. For GTK1 apps, if you are having problems
with font encodings, set the QT_GTK_ENC to your required encoding. e.g.

           export QT_GTK_ENC=iso8859-2

(For compatibility with Geramik, QTPIXMAP_GTK_ENC may also be used...)

You may also tell QtCurve to use an alternative font for GTK1 apps. For instance if you are
using "Verdana" for KDE apps, but this looks bad in GTK1 apps (as they use a different font
mechanism), you can tell QtCurve to substitute Helvetic for this. To do this, edit either
/etc/X11/qt_gtk_fnt2fntrc, or $HOME/.qt/gtk_fnt2fntrc and add lines such as:

Arial=Helvetica
Verdana=Helvetica

...etc.

Blue/FreeCurve
--------------

The following is a list of some of the changes in this theme:

    Use KDE colours/fonts
    Better check and radio buttons - consistant between Qt, Gtk1, and Gtk2
    Pushbuttons now depress
    Comboboxes - fixed arrow size, and remove line from underneath arrow
    New sliders
    Draw box around splitter
    Better KDE progress bar
    More consistent spinboxes
    Removed slashes - replaced with horiz/vert lines
    New toolbar/menu bar handles.

...and a *lot* more. Basically this theme hardly looks like Blue/FreeCurve anymore. With the
possible exception of progressbars, and slected menu-items.
