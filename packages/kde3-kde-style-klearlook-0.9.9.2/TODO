KDE: Combo box has a lighter grey when disabled
GTK1: Mozilla - tab bar seems to let tabs overlap? This also affects Geramik,
      think the problem is with Mozilla.
KDE: Slight re-draw error on tabs if width of all tabs= width of tab bar -- but
     all KDE themes seem to suffer from this.
KDE: Mising white pixel when last tab is selected, if its added then the above 
     suffers even more!
KDE: V3 Combobox list needs to be rounded in rounded mode - missing pixels, etc.
     Also take into account scrollbar pos? i.e. draw line 1 pixel less on right?
ALL: AA selected/gradient radios - in high contrast looks very sharp
ALL: GTK/KDE have different disabled text behaviour when contrast setting changed!

--new--

KDE: Fix OO.o menubar.
GTK: Slightly differnt menu colour?
GTK: Implement kde settings stuff from GtkQt and the qt gtk engine.
ALL: Make highlight factor a configurable value
KDE: spinbox buttons need to hightlight just button that mouse is over!
KDE: Konqueror's sidebar - whats going on with 1st button? (look's like its an unthemed seperarator)
