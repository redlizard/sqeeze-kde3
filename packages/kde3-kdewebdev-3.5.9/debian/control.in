 in KDE docbook format, which can only be read by Konqueror or KHelpCenter.
 This package provides all of the KDE web development documentation converted
 to HTML format so it can be read with any web browser.
 .
 The documentation will be installed into the usual directories

 KDE web development packages.

Description: visual dialog builder and executor tool
 Kommander is a visual dialog building tool whose primary objective is
 to create as much functionality as possible without using any scripting
 language.
 .
 More specifically, Kommander is a set of tools that allow you to create
 dynamic GUI dialogs that generate, based on their state, a piece of
 text. The piece of text can be a command line to a program, any piece
 of code, business documents that contain a lot of repetitious or
 templated text and so on.
 .
 The resulting generated text can then be executed as a command line
 program (hence the name "Kommander"), written to a file, passed to a
 script for extended processing, and literally anything else you can
 think of. And you aren't required to write a single line of code!
 .
 As well as building dialogs, Kommander may be expanded to create full
 mainwindow applications.
 .
