Title: Kommander Handbook
Author: Marc Britton <consume@optushome.com.au>, Tamara King <tik@acm.org> and Eric Laffoon <sequitur@kde.org>
Abstract: Kommander is a set of tools that allow you to create dynamic
 GUI dialogs that generate, based on their state, a piece of text.  The
 piece of text can be a command line to a program, any piece of code,
 business documents that contain a lot of repititious or templated text
 and so on.  The resulting generated text can then be executed as a
 command line program (hence the name "Kommander"), written to a file,
 passed to a script for extended processing, and literally anything else
 you can think of.  The best part of it all?  You aren't required to write
 a single line of code!
