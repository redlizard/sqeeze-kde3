Quanta Plus for Debian
----------------------

Reference Documentation:

  Quanta Plus is able to display reference documentation from several
  external sources.

  Reference documentation for HTML, CSS and PHP can be downloaded as
  separate Debian packages, wdg-html-reference and php-doc.  Note that
  php-doc is non-free, but without it, you'll get file-not-found errors
  in your documentation pane.  Once these packages are installed, Quanta
  Plus will be able to access this documentation out of the box.

  JavaScript and MySQL reference documentation is also available but is
  not supported natively by this package.  To make JavaScript or MySQL
  documentation accessible in Quanta Plus, download the relevant documentation
  tarball from http://sourceforge.net/projects/quanta/.  You should unpack
  this tarball beneath ~/.kde/share/apps/quanta/doc/, so that the file
  javascript.docrc or mysql.docrc is unpacked directly into this directory.

HTML Documentation:

  Quanta Plus provides documentation in a docbook format that the
  KDE Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read
  in any web browser, see the package kdewebdev-doc-html.

Kommander:

  The Kommander GUI script builder and executor that ships with Quanta Plus
  has been split out of the main quanta package and can now be found in the
  separate kommander package.

Quanta Plus is not in any way affiliated with any commercial versions of
Quanta.  The primary coders from the original team left the GPLed
version to produce a commercial product.
