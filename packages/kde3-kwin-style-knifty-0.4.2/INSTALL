Basic Installation (from the console):
  - Step 1
      $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
  - Step 2
      $ make
  - Step 3 (as root)
      # make install

where PREFIX is the path to your kde
installation eg: /usr, /opt/kde

If configure fails, check that you have both
the QT and KDE development headers installed.

Debian note: You may need to append
--with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3
to the configure line.
