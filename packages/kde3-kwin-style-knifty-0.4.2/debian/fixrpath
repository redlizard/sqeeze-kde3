# libtool -rpath workaround based on a suggestion by Yann Dirson
# <dirson@debian.org>
#
# It is supposed to be inserted in configure.in, but I didn't want
# to re-run autoconf (since that bloats the Debian diff unnecessarily),
# so I just patch libtool after running configure.  -- Richard Braakman

#
# The version of libtool included with LessTif unfortunately insists on
# linking with -rpath, i.e. hardwiring locations. This is not desirable.
#
# The dummy define is improbable enough not to conflict with anything; it is
# just here to fool libtool by making it believe it gave some useful info to
# gcc.
#
# This will also patch the generated libtool to explicitly
# link libraries against the libraries they depend on.  (particularly libc)
