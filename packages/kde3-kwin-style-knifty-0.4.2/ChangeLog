0.4.2
- Fix compile for gcc 3.4.x
- Make titlebar buttons only react on left-click, if they have one function
  only. (Bug #58220)
- Set the correct state for OnAllDesktop/Maximize buttons in the initialization. 
- Some minor cleanups...
0.4.1
- Update to recent API changes in KWin CVS.
0.4.0
- Ported to the KDE 3.2 window decoration API (thank
  you Michael Pyne!).
- Cleaned up the configuration dialog:
  - Removed the "shrink borders" setting. (use KWin's
    "allow moving and resizing of maximized windows"
    setting.)
  - Removed the "border size" setting. (Configurable
    globally in KWin now.)
  - Removed the "titlebar height" setting. (Overlapping
    with the font size setting & quite limited space for
    the config dialog :) )
