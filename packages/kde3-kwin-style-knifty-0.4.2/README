"Knifty" is a neat native KWin window decoration for KDE 3.x
based on the nice KWin theming HOWTO by David Johnson. Also
I've "stolen" some code from the excellent "MKUltra"/"Web"
KWin decos and the KDE CVS KDesktop ShadowEngine class by
Laur Ivan. ;-) Thankyou all!

You can find info about installing in the INSTALL file; the
