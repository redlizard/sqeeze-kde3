    If ever an app crashes (heaven forbid!) then Dr.Konqi will be so kind
    and make a stack trace. This is a great help for the developers to fix
    the bug.

* kappfinder
    Searches for non-KDE applications, e.g. Acrobat Reader (tm) and installs
    those apps under the K start button.

Common Mistakes
---------------
IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  Please set this in your login file.

If XPM support wasn't configured, it may be that configure has no idea where
your XPM libraries are.  If so, set XPM_INCLUDE and XPM_LDFLAGS to the paths
where configure should look for XPM.  But if you haven't installed XPM or it
didn't come with your system, that's no problem.  You will only miss a few
screensavers.  The same thing applies with OPENGL support.  Here you have to
set GL_INCLUDE and GL_LDFLAGS.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com and download the latest Qt 3.3.x release.

Be advised, if you're using FreeBSD, then please do not use the Qt port that
comes along with it.

Configuring
-----------
kdebase's configure script supports all the standard GNU autoconf options
(you can have the various options listed for you by specifying the --help
switch), plus the following options are also supported.  Note: the *non*
default variation is listed, so if you see --enable-debug, the default is
--disable debug.

`--x-includes=DIR'
     use X include files in DIR

`--x-libraries=DIR'
     use X library files in DIR

`--enable-debug'
     creates debugging code [default=no]

`--enable-strict'
     Add strict[er] compiler options (may not work!) to the CFLAGS and
     CXXFLAGS.  This is GNU CC specific for the time being.

`--with-gnu-ld'
     assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]

`--disable-libtool-lock'
     force libtool not to do file locking

`--disable-nls'
     do not use Native Language Support (i18n)

`--with-qt-dir'
     where the root of qt is installed 

`--with-qt-includes=DIR'
     look for the Qt header files in DIR

`--with-qt-libraries=DIR'
     look for the Qt library in DIR

`--with-extra-includes=DIR'
     look for include files in DIR in addition to any other
     `standard' paths

`--with-extra-libs=DIR'
     look for [extra] libraries in DIR too

`--disable-path-check'
     don't try to make sure that kdebase is installed into the same
     base KDE directory as the rest of KDE
 
`--with-install-root=DIR'
     the root to install to [default=/] (i.e. make / == DIR, so /usr
     becomes DIR/usr)

`--disable-rpath'
     do not use the rpath feature of ld

`--with-xdmdir=DIR'
     use xdm (and config files) from DIR if the xdm config dir can't be
     found automaticly

`--with-pam[=ARG]'
     enable support for PAM: ARG=[yes|no|service name]

`--with-shadow'
     if you want to check for and use shadow password support if it's present

`--without-gl'
     disable any software which depends on OpenGL

`--without-xpm'
     disable color pixmap XPM tests

`--with-xinerama'
     enable Xinerama support

Please check ./configure --help for a more current list of options and what
they do. 


Debugging
---------
You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs. If you experience problems and want to
report problems to the KDE Bugs database, it is recommended to recompile
with this switch enabled to make the backtraces more verbose (and thus
giving the developer more information about the cause of the bug).


Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------
You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely, and is depreciated. On a system
where KDEDIR is specific to KDE (i.e. not /usr), rm -rf $KDEDIR does it as
well.


More Info
---------
If your system does not have XPM installed, and you cannot locate a package
of it, you may obtain it from ftp://avahi.inria.fr/pub/xpm, or you may find
it in ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles

If you are running a FreeBSD system, you will need to make sure that LIBS is
set to "-Wl,-export-dynamic".  The easiest way to do this is to prefix
configure with it, i.e.: LIBS="-Wl,-export-dynamic" ./configure.  Thanks to
Will Andrews <will@FreeBSD.org> and Arun Sharma <adsharma@sharmas.dhs.org>
for identifying what needed to be done, and how to do it, and such.

If your system supports PAM (Plugable Authentication Modules), please see
the README.pam file in this directory for more information about using KDE
with PAM.

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you would like to find out
more about a specific application included in kdebase.

If you have problems compiling and installing this package, please check the
kde-devel@kde.org mailing list archive (see http://lists.kde.org) to see if
somebody had a similiar problem already. If not, try posting a message to
the list with detailed information about the compile problem.

General KDE discussions should go to the KDE mailing list (kde@kde.org).
