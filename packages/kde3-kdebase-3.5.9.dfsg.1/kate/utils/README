What it is
==========

This library is a container for classes that may be usefull for
Kate and for kate plugins. If you have a class that you think would
be usefull for other plugins, ask the maintainer of this library
to put it here.

If you find a class in a plugin (ore even elsewhere) that you need to
copy in order to use it inside kate or a kate plugin, consider debating with
the author of that class to move it here.

To fit in, the class must be generic enough that it can be usefull for
many purposes.

Apart from the convenience (and avoided copies of code) putting classes in this
library will help us maintain a common feel of how kate works.
