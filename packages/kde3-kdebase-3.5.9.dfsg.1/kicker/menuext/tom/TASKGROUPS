Task Groups
===========
Tasks are grouped into common families of functionality. These groups are then
stored in a standard KDE configuration file. The General category in the
config file defines the icon (Icon), user visible name (Name), the number
of tasks in the group (NumTasks) and optionally whether or not it is hidden
(Hidden).

For each task there is a numbered section in the file in the form TaskN. Each
section contains the user visible name for the task (Name), the associated
.desktop file and optionally whether or not it is hidden (Hidden).

An example file can be found below.

Alternatives
============
Alternative formats are possible, including making it more like the servicemenu
.desktop format or the new virtual menu freedesktop.org draft standard. Here are
the pros and cons of each of these options:

servicemenu style:
 o CONS: no extra flexibility, still have to do most checking manually
 o PROS: familiar format

virtual menu style:
 o CONS: it's XML and that's way more trouble that we need to go through, and it
         isn't really designed with this sort of menu in mind
 o PROS: it's becoming a standard for desktop menus
