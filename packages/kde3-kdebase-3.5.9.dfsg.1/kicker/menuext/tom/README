What is TOM?
============
TOM stands for Task Oriented Menu and is a work in progress that will become a
viable alternative to the current KMenu. Its goals include:

 o Be task oriented
 o Be simple and clear to use
 o Create a smaller but usable menu
 o Limited configurability through sensible defaults
 o Have all configuration needs built right into the menu, including:
   o Editor dialogs that can be called up from entries in the menu
   o Context menus accessed by RMB clicking on a task for powerusers
 o Allow locking down of menus through immutable settings
   o Obeys Kicker and KDE Kiosk settings
   o By making the TOM group of kickerrc immutable all config is removed
   o By making a task group's rc file immutable, config options are removed
 o Not require any modifications to the KDE menu system (applnk, etc)


What is a "Task Oriented Menu"?
================================
A task oriented menu displays it's entries as "things to do" (or tasks) rather
than simply listing all items that are available. Each of these tasks has an
application or command associated with it, and this associated command can be
changed without changing the task name or placement within the menu. The tasks
are grouped by function and may map to programs, documents or actions.


Todo list
=========
Editor dialogs
Make the Destination entries work (only Run A Command is done)
Populate and track Recent Applications menu entries
  o Application launching should be caught somewhere in the KDE libs, ala
    Recent Documents
Writing out of config files to reflect runtime changes (deleted entries, etc)
  o This requires keeping track of the config files used in creating the menu
KDEDIR merging
  o KDEDIRS are already consulted for taskgroups, but groups of the same name
    should be merged
Sane merging of menuext entries
  o "Recent" items should go into the recent section
    o Replace TOM's builin recent docs with the menuext version?
    o Create a Recent Applications menuext?
  o Add a way to quickly add/remove menuext items from TOM
    (ala "Modify These Tasks")
Check for updates on launch and bring them down/install them if they exist
  o this includes new apps installed on the local box showing up in the menu
  o "Get cool stuff" integration?
Further refinement of wording / ordering in main menu (a perpetual TODO ;)
Creation of real-world task groups
Support plugins which can add arbitrary functionality to the menu


Debate list
===========
What should be the default task entry format be:
    a) Task Name
    b) Task Name (App Name)
    c) App Name (Task Name)  <-- silly option =)
Should "Run A Command..." be replaced by an inline combobox?
    Pros: It's more obvious and will work even if kdesktop is gone. The widget
          is already written (in tom.cc)
    Cons: It makes it stand out too much over other entries, takes up more room
          and isn't as powerful as the full minicli
