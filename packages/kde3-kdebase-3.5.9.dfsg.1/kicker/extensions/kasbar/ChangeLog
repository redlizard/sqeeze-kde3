2004-09-03 Friday 22:32  rich

	  masked so   that when you have a non-rectangular bar (by using
	  the 'Boxes per line'	 setting) the unused space is truly unused.
	  To make this better, I need to   make it so that the box is
	  always populated from the screen edge outwards.

	  things and made   more advanced popup handling possible.

2004-08-01 Sunday 02:55  rich

	* - KasItem is now responsible for drawing the main icon of the
	  boxes.

	  - KasItem now provides a demo childbar as the default
	  implementation of   createPopup(). This means that you now get a
	  nice popup when you move   the mouse over the item in the about
	  dialog.

2004-08-01 Sunday 01:45  rich

	* - Began moving support for child bars to the kasbar base class

	  - Support for custom sizes (incomplete).

	  - Improvements to the configuration dialog.

2003-10-06 Monday 23:27  rich

	* Fix vertical mode

2003-10-06 Monday 20:11  rich

	* Fix problem with maxBoxes fix.

2003-10-04 Saturday 21:36  rich

	* - Split the 'max boxes' concept into two so we can handle things
	  properly. The   original max boxes remains, and refers to the
	  user specified limit on the	number of boxes per line. In
	  addition there is now a 'boxes per line'   concept which stores
	  the number of boxes that will actually fit. This change   cleans
	  up the configuration handling and also means that kasbar can obey
	  the	size limits placed on it.

	  - Take notice of the size limits passed to the widget. This means
	  the size   limits for extension that were added in 3.1 will now
	  work properly.

	  - Disable updates when refreshing the entire task list. This
	  removes lots of   flicker when changing desktops when you don't
	  show all the tasks.

	  - Improved the resize handling code so that can handle changes in
	  the item   size cleanly.

	  - Updated copyright dates.

2003-09-30 Tuesday 22:25  rich

	  class.

	  - Removed redundant reload of configuration info.

	  - Reworked painting	- Double buffering is now handled by KasBar
	  not the items.    - Items now longer force an immediate repaint,
	  they use update instead.    - Fixes #53735

	  CCMAIL: 53735-done@bugs.kde.org

2003-08-07 Thursday 19:51  lunakl

	* Rewrite handling of _NET_WM_ICON_NAME. This together with the

	  display what it's supposed to display. Please yell if something
	  is still wrong.

2003-07-31 Thursday 10:31  lunakl

	* Proper handling of _NET_WM_ICON_NAME - it has nothing to do with
	  what's usually meant by icons in KDE, but it's the text to be
	  shown in iconic representations of a window, such as taskbar
	  entries.
