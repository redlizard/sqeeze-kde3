<p align="center"><strong>KDEPrinting (I)</strong></p>
<p><strong>kprinter</strong>, KDE's new printing utility supports
different print subsystems. These subsystems differ very much
in their abilities.</p>
<p>Among the supported systems are:
<ul>
<li>CUPS, the new Common UNIX Printing System;</li>
<li>LPR/LPD, traditional BSD-style printing;</li>
<li>RLPR (no need for "printcap" editing or root privileges to
use network printers);</li>
<li>printing through an external program (generic).</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><strong>KDEPrinting (II)</strong></p>

<p>Not all print subsystems provide equal abilities
for KDEPrint to build on.</p>
<p>The <A HREF="http://printing.kde.org/">KDEPrinting Team</A>
recommends installing a <A
HREF="http://www.cups.org/"><strong>CUPS-based</strong></A>
software as the underlying print subsystem.</p>
<p> CUPS provides easy usage, powerful features, broad printer
support and a modern design (based on IPP, the "Internet
Printing Protocol"). Its usefulness is proven for home users
as well as for large networks.

If you need to calculate a distance on the screen, the program
<em>kruler</em> can be of great help.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, if you need to look closely at the ruler to count single
pixels, <em>kmag</em> may be very useful. (It is not part of the KDE base
installation but needs to be installed separately. It might already be
available on your distribution.) <em>kmag</em> works
just like <em>xmag</em>, with the difference that it magnifies on the fly.

Most non-KDE sound applications that do not know about the sound server can be
run using the <b>artsdsp</b> command. When the application is run, accesses to
the audio device will be redirected to the <b>artsd</b> sound server.

The command format is:<br>

KDE's 'kioslaves' do not just work in Konqueror: you can use network
URLs in any KDE application. For example, you can enter a URL like
ftp://www.server.com/myfile in the Kate Open dialog, and Kate will
open the file and save changes back to the FTP server when you click
on 'Save.'

You can use Konqueror to access your files on any server that you have

KDE applications offer short "What's This?" help texts for many

<p>KDE is always looking to improve its accessibility, and with the
launch of KTTS (KDE Text-to-Speech) you now have the power to convert
strings of text into audible speech. </p>

<p>KTTS is constantly improving, and currently provides support to
speak all or any portion of plain text files (as viewed in Kate), HTML
pages in Konqueror, text in the KDE clipboard, as well as speech of
KDE notifications (KNotify).</p>

<p>To start the KTTS system, you can either select KTTS in the KDE
menu, or hit Alt+F2 to run a command and then type <b>kttsmgr</b>. For
more information on KTTS, check the <a href="help:/kttsd" title="KTTSD

<p>Though KDE is a very stable desktop environment, programs may
occasionally freeze or crash, particularly if you are running the
development version of a program, or a program made by a
third-party. In this case, you can forcibly kill the program if need
be.</p>

<p>Pressing <b>Ctrl+Alt+Esc</b> will bring up the skull-and-crossbones
cursor, and once you click on a window with it the program will be
automatically killed. Note, however, that this is an untidy way of
shutting down the program which may result in data being lost, and
some partner processes may still remain running. This should only be
used as a last resort.</p>

suite, and it integrates all components under it seamlessly.</p>

<p>Other possible programs to integrate with Kontact include
KAddressBook (for handling Contacts), KNotes (for keeping notes),
KNode (to keep up-to-date with the latest news), and KOrganizer (for a

<p>While remembering passwords may be tedious, and writing them down

application that can save and manage all of your passwords in strongly
encrypted files, and permit access to them with the use of one master
password.</p>

<p>KWallet can be accessed from kcontrol, KDE's Control Center; from

<p>While tabbed browsing in Konqueror is very useful, you can take
this one step further if you choose to have a split view in order to
view two locations at the same time. To access this feature, in
Konqueror select Window->Split View, with either Top-Bottom or
Left/Right, depending upon your choice.</p>

<p>This setting will also only apply to a particular tab, rather than
all tabs you have, so you can choose to have the split view for only
some of the tabs where you might think it is useful.</p>
