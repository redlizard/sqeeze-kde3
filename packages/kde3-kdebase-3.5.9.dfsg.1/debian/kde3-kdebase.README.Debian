KDE and media kioslave support
==============================

The media kioslave, new in KDE 3.4, supports the automatic mounting of
removable devices, such as CD-ROM and DVD drives, USB pen drives, digital
cameras, and many other types of equipment.

While some functionality is available without the use of HAL, media works
best with HAL (and therefore udev), in combination with pmount. Media
also extends the functionality of many other kioslaves. Check which
packages are recommended by the kdebase-kio-plugins package, and install
accordingly.

Note that for regular users to use media in conjunction with HAL, they must
be members of the plugdev group (permanently, not through
/etc/security/group.conf).


KControl and Logitech mice
==========================

In combination with the udev packages, KControl supports the
advanced configuration of many models of Logitech mice, though regular users
must be members of the plugdev group for this to work.

After installing KControl for the first time, or updating to KControl 3.4.x
or later from an earlier package, you will need to unplug and then replug
your mouse, in order to force udev to grant special permissions
to your mouse, so that KControl can perform advanced configuration.
Rebooting or restarting udev will of course accomplish the same
thing.


Installing konsole's bitmap fonts
=================================

Formerly, the few bitmap fonts KDE included, designed for use with Konsole,
were shipped as part of the xfonts-konsole package. However, as Konsole no
longer uses these fonts by default, and most users no longer use bitmap
fonts at all, KDE now includes these fonts with Konsole itself, and Debian
has followed this practice, including the fonts in the konsole package, and
eliminating the xfonts-konsole package entirely.

To make use of these legacy fonts, start Konsole, and under Settings --> Font
select "Install Bitmap...". This will allow you to copy the legacy Konsole
fonts to $HOME/.fonts, where, after restarting KDE, all applications run by
that user, including Konsole, will be able to find them. Also make sure that
fontconfig is configured to allow the use of bitmap fonts. If you're not sure,
run, as root, 'dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig' from Konsole.
