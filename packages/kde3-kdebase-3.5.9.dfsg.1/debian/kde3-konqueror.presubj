Reporting a konqueror crash
---------------------------

When you report a konqueror crash, it is important to provide:
 * the exact steps to reproduce the crash (URL of the site, the exact
   actions you performed...)
 * a useful backtrace of the crash

To produce a useful backtrace, you must have qt-x11-free-dbg, kdelibs-dbg,
and kdebase-dbg installed. A backtrace full of "(no debugging symbols
found)" is useless.

A bug that is not reproducible, or that lacks the necessary backtrace, will
be discarded.


Reporting a rendering bug
-------------------------

Please provide the URL of the page that doesn't display correctly. Explain
clearly what you expect, and what you actually get.

Small screenshots of the part that has a problem are of great help and can
be attached to the bug report. Screenshots of the "correct" behaviour
(taken on another graphical browser) may also help.

Any bug that states "Site foo is not rendered correctly" with no further
information will be discarded (even if at the time of the report the defect
is obvious, with newer versions of KDE it can be hard to see if the defect
is still present, since the error might have been subtle for all we know).
