.TH KDESU 1 "May 2005" "K Desktop Environment" "Runs a program with elevated privileges."
.SH NAME
kdesu \- Runs a program with elevated privileges.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkdesu\fR [Qt\-options] [KDE\-options] [kdesu options] command 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs a program with elevated privileges.
.PP
KDE su is a graphical front end to the Unix \fBsu\fR utility. It allows you to run programs as another user by entering their password. It is not a SUID root program, but runs unprivileged. The system program \fBsu\fR is used for acquiring special privileges.
.PP
\fBkdesu\fR has the ability to store passwords for the convenience of users. The passwords are NOT written to disk, but stored in memory using a special program, \fBkdesud\fR. This is only done if the user specifies that the password be remembered. In this case, passwords are stored in memory for a certain period of time before being removed. \fBkdesud\fR runs in such a way that only the user who entered the password originally can use it, though no one, not even the user who originally entered the password, can retrieve the password that is stored by \fBkdesud\fR. Through these measures, users can avoid having to repeatedly enter root passwords or other passwords, without a significant risk to overall system security.
.PP
\fBkdesu\fR uses normally \fBsu\fR to gain root by using the root password. \fBkdesu\fR can also be configured to use other commands to gain root like sudo to use users password.
