used by any software in need of user authentication, most
notably screensavers.

It enhances security be the following means:
.br
.IP "     \-"
It's only a small program, which is hopefully simple enough to
allow it to be SUID root. Setting it to SUID root is necessary
on Shadow Password systems.
.IP "     \-"
No other program in need of user authentication, must be
SUID root.
.IP "     \-"
It provides a single implementation to check passwords. So one only must take a closer look at \fBKCheckPass\fP to ensure password security. It's much easier for programs using \fBKCheckPass\fP to preserve security.
