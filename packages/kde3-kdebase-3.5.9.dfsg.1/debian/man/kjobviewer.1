.TH KJOBVIEWER 1 "June 2006" "K Desktop Environment" "A print job viewer"
.SH NAME
kjobviewer
\- a print job viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkjobviewer\fP [Qt\-options] [KDE\-options] [options] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBKJobViewer\fP is a powerful queue and spool manager. You can view jobs in the different queues waiting for print as well as manipulate jobs in many ways.
.sp 1
The details are, again, as with all other modules of \fBKDEPrint\fP, dependent on the print subsystem in use. \fBCUPS\fP, as is usual now, in this field is the most feature\-complete system for "doing something with jobs that are sent away already and wait for print, possibly on a remote print server".
.sp 1
With kjobviewer you can...
.IP "     \-"
see an overview for a certain queue or see all jobs on all queues;
.IP "     \-"
filter the list to see your "own" jobs only;
.IP "     \-"
sort the pending jobs according to different criteria (size, ownership, job\-ide, job\-name; billing\-tags);
.IP "     \-"
stop a job from printing, putting it into a "held" state;
.IP "     \-"
re\-start a held job;
.IP "     \-"
manually release a job that was sent to "hold" from the client already;
.IP "     \-"
reschedule a job for printing at a specified time;
.IP "     \-"
increase or decrease the job\-priorities (allowed values are 1\-100) to re-arrange the order of automatic printing;
.IP "     \-"
move a job to a different print\-queue;
.IP "     \-"
stop jobs from leaving the queue (while still accepting incoming ones);
.IP "     \-"
reject new incoming jobs (while still printing all the pending ones until the queue is empty);
.IP "     \-"
check and re\-set all job options \-\- even adapt them to another target printet which might have a complete different set of commands;
.IP "     \-"
view the existing and re\-assign a new job\-billing tag to a job;
.IP "     \-"
pop up on screen a nicely formatted report of IPP attributes for any job and also print it;
.IP "     \-"
increase or decrease the number of required copies;
.IP "     \-"
cancel and delete a no-longer\-required job.
.PP
Note, that some of these manipulations require job ownership or root access.
