.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkdm\fP [options] [tty]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkdm\fP is the KDE display manager also known as login manager. It shows a graphical login screen for username and password. After authenticating the user it starts a session.

\fBkdm\fP can be configured for remote login via XDMCP. XDMCP is the "X Display Manager Control Protocol" which is used to set up connections between remote systems over the network.

\fBkdm\fP is a derivative of \fBxdm\fP. \fBman 1 xdm\fP may provide useful information (requires installed \fBxdm\fP). For X-related problems try \fBman 7x X\fP and \fBman 1 startx\fP.
