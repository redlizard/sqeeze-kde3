kdebase (4:3.5.5a.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add 4 new patches. Thanks to Sune Vuorela for investigating and
    to Modestas Vainius for creating them:
    * 29_halbackend_fstab_improvements
      * fixes HALBackend::inInFstab() to correctly match the fstab device node
        that is a symlink.
      * Improve error messages for HAL/fstab unmount failures. Include a list
        of processes using the device in them (if there are any).
      * When handling fstab devices, make HALBackend::mount() and
        HALBackend::umount() calls block until the operation actually
        completes (the same behaviour as with HAL devices).
      * In mounthelper always unmount a device before ejecting it. However,
        if unmount fails, still try to eject the device. In case of failure,
        display the unmount error message which is more informative.
    * 30_mediamanager_followsymlinks
      * MediaManager::properties() follows symlinks on local paths.
    * 32_camera_icon_from_mimetype
      * Do not set icons for cameras explicitly, because they can be
        determined from the mimetype. In addition, always reset a medium icon
        when properties of the medium change. This fixes a problem when the
        camera_mounted icon is not reset once the camera storage has been
        unmounted.
    * 33_mounthelper_find_medium_by_url
      * Mounthelper should search for the medium by the whole url in addition
        to just the filename. This unbreaks krusader 1.70.x media:/ 
        unmount/eject commands.

  * Add psmisc to Depends of kdebase-kio-plugins since it provides 'fuser'
    utility, needed for listUsingProcesses() function added in
    29_halbackend_fstab_improvements patch. Thanks to Modestas Vainius.

  * Promote eject from Recommends to Depends for kdesktop, and make sure
    kdebase-kio-plugins Depends on kdesktop, so that kdeeject is always
    present.

  * Update 20_applications_menu_move patch to fix an incomptability with
    freedesktop.org menu specification: Note that a system that uses either
    gnome-applications.menu or kde-applications.menu depending on the desktop
    environment in use must still use applications-merged as the default merge
    directory in both cases. Thanks to Kevin Krammer. (Closes: #392807)

  * Version our build-conflict with nvidia-glx, since newer packages should
    work. (Closes: #393855)

  * Drop thunderbird and mozilla icons from the tarball, as they are non-free.

  * Re-add pmount to kdebase's dependencies. It turns out that there remain
    strange cases where pmount is needed in conjunction with HAL to do the
    right thing.

kdebase (4:3.5.5a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream tarball, with a number of fixes. Also include several
    important patches that didn't make the tarball.
    + Fixes 'konsole flashes and is unusable' with some focus policies.
      (Closes: #391357, #391361)
    + This upload, and the last one, must make Etch with their RC fixes,
      so urgency=high.

  * Drop the pmount Depends from the kdebase metapackage, since pmount isn't
    important with the latest HAL. (Closes: #391502)

kdebase (4:3.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers ]
  * New upstream release.
    + Reorders the paths which kxkb searches. This should prevent it from
      mistakenly thinking that it has found its data; this was breaking
      keyboard layouts for many users. (Closes: #382988)
    + Fixes kxkb with multiple users - create properly named files in /tmp.
      (Closes: #383893)
    + Fixes kdesktop crash when copying things to the kde clipboard under
      special configuration. (Closes: #386336)
    + Fixes kicker external taskbar sizing. (Closes: #373919)

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Join the club by adding full depends on hal and pmount to the kdebase
    metapackage. kdebase-kio-plugins will retain recommends for hal and
    pmount. This way, people who still really hate udev can simply ditch the
    kdebase metapackage, but most users will automatically get the full
    Utopia. This is good, since nobody reads recommends anyway, and volume
    handling is becoming standard and expected basic functionality. The
    kde-desktop task depends on kde-core, a metapackage that in turn
    depends on kdebase, so the kde-desktop task will now pull in hal/pmount
    as well. (Closes: #384663)

  * Fix typo in /etc/pam.d/kdm-np. (Closes: #381908)

  * Remove /usr/share/apps/kappfinder/apps/Office/lyx.desktop, as lyx-qt
    provides its own better .desktop file. (Closes: #383412)

  * Revamp patches/18_default_fonts.diff, not only to sync it with the latest
    changes in the KDE_3_5_BRANCH, but also to fix a number of recent problems
    with KDE's font handling. These include mismatches between defaults in
    different parts of KDE, which led to different apps using different
    settings, with respect to the enabling of anti-aliasing, subpixel
    rendering, and other settings. Also, set the default font hinting level
    to 'full', since anything other than that has the effect of actually
    disabling hinting with Debian's fontconfig. This probably led many users
    to wonder why their fonts suddenly became so ugly after they ran KControl
    and accepted the then-default 'medium' hinting level. (Closes: #381232)

  * Clarify in the kdebase and kdebase-kio-plugins README.Debian files that
    plugdev membership through /etc/security/group.conf doesn't cut it.

  * Add Romanian debconf translation, thanks to Stan Ioan-Eugen.
    (Closes: #387586)

  * New default background, thanks to Andre L.R. Ferreira. This background was
    chosen from a group of images proposed for a standard Debian background by
    the Debian Desktop project. This work doesn't look like it will make Etch,
    but the old background wasn't super, so we took the one we judged to be
    best.

  * Grab a few minipager fixes from the KDE_3_5_BRANCH.

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Re-upload 3.5.4 with a new build hack that disables the use of
    --enable-final on slow architectures. This will hopefully allow kdebase
    (and other KDE modules) to build on arm and m68k more easily. This should
    in turn ease the movement of recent KDE modules into Testing. Thanks to

  * Improve kpager's package description. Thanks to David Liontooth.
    (Closes: #366476)

  * Update the kate manpage. (Closes: #347883)

  * Manually add /usr/bin/X11 to the KDM's default session path, as otherwise
    systems still running X11R6.9 won't be able to find X binaries, which can
    cause the login process to fail under certain circumstances. This bit of

  * Add 'ru' debconf templates translation, thanks to Yuriy Talakan.

kdebase (4:3.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Now that menu-xdg+menu can provide xsession .desktop files for window
    managers, add /var/lib/menu-xdg/xsessions to kdmrc's default list of
    places to search. Window managers should continue to provide their
    own .desktop files, however, since they will be more customized and
    won't force users to install the menu package. This is merely a
    fallback. (Closes: #360919)

  * Make kdm look for /usr/bin/X by default, now that /usr/X11R6 is on its way
    out. Adjust other paths in kdmrc as well. kdm should now work better with
    X.Org 7. (Closes: #362924)

  * Patch kdm so that if it can't find the X executable in kdmrc (now
    /usr/bin/X by default), then try /usr/X11R6/bin/X, then finally
    /usr/bin/X. This should keep kdm working for users who have a partial or
    botched dist-upgrade, or neglected to permit the installation of an
    up-to-date kdmrc.

  * Revamp /etc/pam.d/kdm and the other pam files. They should now find the
    new /etc/default/locale language settings. (Closes: #361089, #361163)

  * Remove xlibs-static-pic build-dependency, and replace it with
    libfontenc-dev, for the more modular X.Org 7. Also add libxkbfile-dev to

  * Tightened build dependency on dbus-qt-1-dev to force building against a
    C++ transitioned version. Can be removed once dbus (>= 0.23.4-5) is
    available on all arches.

  * Tighten all package relations between packages in kdebase, preventing many
    instances of potentially harmful partial upgrades. In particular, ensure
    that kdm is upgraded along with kdebase-bin. (Closes: #312358)

  * Fix typos in the kappfinder manpage. Thanks to A Costa. (Closes: #312767)

  * Add a patch that makes knotify aware that arts is available when arts is
    manually started. This (more or less) resolves the issue wherein knotify
    did not work with arts, had arts ever once been unavailable.
    (Closes: #312217)

  * No longer set a random ForgingSeed in the kdmrc conffile, for this caused
    each kdebase build to generate a different kdmrc, and therefore made
    updates a nuissance.

  * Make kdm Suggest kdepasswd, since the later contains icons that can be
    used to provide users with 'face' icons.

  * New upstream release.

kdebase (4:3.4.0-0pre4) alioth; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * Bugs reported in the Debian BTS fixed by this release:

    - KDE can now use pmount if available. (Closes: #294258)

    - drag'n'dropping local files from Konqueror to Thunderbird works now
      (file:/// is used instead of file:/ for the url). (Closes: #296255)

    - konsole now uses a proper set of default fonts, resulting in less
      obvious corruption. (Closes: #289468)

  * Converted packaging to CDBS (initial version by Daniel Schepler, further
    changes by Christopher Martin and Adeodato Simó).

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Added a patch to set reasonable default fonts, using the fontconfig
    defaults, for kpersonalizer, kcontrol, kdm, and the Plastik theme. We
    also use the Debian Blue artwork to provide a standard desktop
    background.

  * KDM no longer shows the Custom session. When it works at all, it simply
    duplicates Default's behaviour anyway. (Closes: #251602)

  * New KDM patches source /etc/profile and the user's normal shell startup
    scripts. (Closes: #173802, #211953, #250645, #250765, #289143)

  * KDM once again looks for window manager session definitions in
    /usr/share/apps/kdm/sessions by default. (Closes: #293645, #310155)

  * USB usermap for Logitech mice is now installed, with device permissions
    set so that members of the plugdev group can make use of the Logitech
    KControl module (under Peripherals/Mouse).

  * Added README.Debian files for kcontrol and kdebase-kio-plugins, explaining
    how to setup Logitech mouse advanced configuration, and the media
    kioslave.

  * New kdebase-doc-html package, containing doc-base registered HTML versions
    of application handbooks, for users without Konqueror or KHelpCenter.

  * Fixed typos in the kate manpage. Thanks to A. Costa. (Closes: #302812)

  * KControl and KInfoCenter are now only visible in the KDE menu. Their
    presence elsewhere had caused user confusion. They are both still
    available through the Debian menu system. Trivial patch borrowed from
    Kubuntu. (Closes: #246280)

  * Make ksmserver Recommend kpersonalizer, since it is used when
    running KDE for the first time. Also patch startkde so it doesn't
    fail when kpersonalizer is not present. (Closes: #309803)

  * Add manpages for kdialog (thanks to Bastian Kleineidam for tracking it
    down) and my own manpage for kdesu/kdesud. (Closes: #239945)

  +++ Changes by Adeodato Simó:

  * After clearing up some issues with multiple de.po files being sent for
    inclusion, include an updated German po-debconf translation sent by
    Florian Ernst, and agreed upon several translators. (Closes: #291954)

  * Created XPM icons for packages having a menu file. Install them in
    /usr/share/pixmaps and update the menu entries to use them.

kdebase (4:3.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * KDE_3_3_BRANCH update.

  * Fix typo in kdebase-bin description. (Closes: #286587)

  * Update kdeprint documentation to sync with kdelibs patches.

  * Add NEWS.Debian for kdm, explaining the "keyboard doesn't work"
    problem when upgrading to KDE 3.3, and how to deal with it.
    (Closes: #266106, #267622)

  * Fix update-alternatives prerm scripts: only --remove when
    the package is actually being removed, not upgraded. This
    should prevent the needless resetting of the sysadmin's
    preferences on package upgrade. (Closes: #247243)

  * Fix debian/copyright to refer to License rather than to Copyright
    when discussing KDE's licenses.

  +++ Changes by Adeodato Simó:

  * debian/control:
    - make kdebase-dev depend on kwin for the libkdecorations.so ->
      libkdecorations.so.1.0.0 symlink. (Closes: #289544)

  * Included Czech po-debconf translation by Miroslav Kure.
    (Closes: #289454)

  * Add manpages for keditbookmarks, konqueror, and kfmclient.
    (Closes: #286373)

  * Acknowledge old NMUs. (Closes: #178507, #261740, #244547, #247407)
    (Closes: #237062, #237065, #237067)
  * Take some action wrt #284844: [AS]
    - rename README.linux.console to README.Linux-font, more explicit
      and does not create confusion with the original file. Removed
      note about this file not being the original one.
    - when talking about dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig, be clear about
      which one the relevant question is and what the answer has to be.
    - added patches/14_konsole_README.Linux-font.diff to make the popup
      that konsole displays when it can find the font specify the full
      path to the README file. (Closes: #284844)

kdebase (4:2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
 
  * Changing version number so that I can re-upload the source.  This is a
    CVS sync with the 2.1 branch which will eventually become 2.1.1
    The main purpose for doing this is to allow an easier way for handling
    upstream fixes as the old source had the head tag and not the branch tag.
  * Fix kmenuedit...not sure how kmenuedit.so got moved to -dev (Closes: #87817)
  * Include utf8.sh as konsole-utf8 (Closes: #87724)
  * Remove hacks for XFT bug
  * Turn off XFT for konsole as konsole doesn't handle AA very well right now
  * Turn off AA support by default...grrrrr..this fixes alot of crashes and
    other issues.  (Closes: #84472)
  * Adding in Recommends for xfonts-scalable and a Suggests for xfs-xtt. If
    AA is turned on and there are no type1 fonts it seems to be very unhappy.
  * Includes fix for QT 2.3.0 so that the url entry problems go away
  * Adding in Suggests for fttools (creates the fonts.dir for truetype fonts
  * More information added to kdebase's README.debian on truetype font 
    setup
  * Make the XFree 3.x.x keytab for konsole the default one to fit policy
  * Fix for stylesheet application (Closes: #87188)
  * The url entry bug is believed to be a bug in QT and a report has gone
    on to trolltech.  The KDE developer who made this report stated that
    a hack patch might be applied to get around it for now.  I'm choosing not
    to go that route.  If the bug is in QT, that's where it needs to be fixed.
    I don't want to have to update this package and QT both to fix a single
    problem and I definatly hate bandaides.
