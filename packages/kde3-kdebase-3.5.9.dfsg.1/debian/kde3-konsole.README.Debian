Installing konsole's bitmap fonts
=================================

Formerly, the few bitmap fonts KDE included, designed for use with Konsole,
were shipped as part of the xfonts-konsole package. However, as Konsole no
longer uses these fonts by default, and most users no longer use bitmap
fonts at all, KDE now includes these fonts with Konsole itself, and Debian
has followed this practice, including the fonts in the konsole package, and
eliminating the xfonts-konsole package entirely.

To make use of these legacy fonts, start Konsole, and under Settings --> Font
select "Install Bitmap...". This will allow you to copy the legacy Konsole
fonts to $HOME/.fonts, where, after restarting KDE, all applications run by
that user, including Konsole, will be able to find them. Also make sure that
fontconfig is configured to allow the use of bitmap fonts. If you're not sure,
run, as root, 'dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig' from Konsole.
