KControl and Logitech mice
==========================

In combination with the udev or hotplug packages, KControl supports the
advanced configuration of many models of Logitech mice, though regular users
must be members of the plugdev group for this to work.

Additionally, the system's kernel must be 2.6.14 or later if you are using
udev, though earlier kernels are also supported if the hotplug package is being
used instead. Kernel hotplugging support is essential, as is usbfs/usbdevfs if
hotplug is being used.

After installing KControl for the first time, or updating to KControl 3.4.x
or later from an earlier package, you will need to unplug and then replug
your mouse, in order to force udev or hotplug to grant special permissions
to your mouse, so that KControl can perform advanced configuration.
Rebooting or restarting udev/hotplug will of course accomplish the same
thing.
