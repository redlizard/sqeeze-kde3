the functional type of the window.  This property SHOULD be used by the window
manager in determining the decoration, stacking position and other behaviour
of the window.  The Client SHOULD specify window types in order of preference
(the first being most preferable), but MUST include at least one of the basic
window type atoms from the list below.  This is to allow for extension of the
list of types, whilst providing default behaviour for window managers that do
not recognise the extensions.  
	</P
><P
>Rationale:  This hint is intend to replace the MOTIF hints.  One of the
objections to the MOTIF hints is that they are a purely visual description of
the window decoration.  By describing the function of the window, the window
manager can apply consistent decoration and behaviour to windows of the same
type.  Possible examples of behaviour include keeping dock/panels on top or
allowing pinnable menus / toolbars to only be hidden when another window has
focus (NextStep style).

modal for, or set to the root window if the dialog is a modal for its window
group.

window's position fixed on the screen, even when the virtual desktop scrolls.

application, i.e. it indicates that the window by nature is never

_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE already conveys the exact nature of the
window.

Pager. Applications should not set this hint if _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE
already conveys the exact nature of the window.
	</P
><P
>_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN should be set by the window manager to indicate
that a window would not be visible on the screen if its
desktop/viewport were active and its coordinates were within the
screen bounds. The canonical example is that minimized windows should
be in the _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN state.  Pagers and similar applications
should use _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN instead of WM_STATE to decide whether
to display a window in miniature representations of the windows on a
desktop.

>_NET_WM_STATE_FLOATING indicates that the window should be on top of other
windows of the same type. Applications should not set this hint

Windows in this state would typically appear above other windows of the same 
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE.

>The purpose of struts is to reserve space at the borders of the desktop.  This

space.
