excess names outside of the _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS are considered to be
reserved in case number of desktops is increased.</P

>Rationale: The name is not a necessary attribute of a virtual desktop. Thus 
the availability or unavailability of names has no impact on virtual desktop
functionality. Since names are set by users and users are likely to preset 
names for a fixed number of desktops, it doesn't make sense to shrink or grow 
this list when the number of available desktops changes.</P
