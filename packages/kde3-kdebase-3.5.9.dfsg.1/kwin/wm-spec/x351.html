>7.1. Desktop/workspace model</A
></H2

independent desktops which may or may not be larger than the screen area.
When a desktop is larger than the screen it is left to the window manager if
it will implement scrolling or paging.

>7.2. File Manager desktop</A
></H2
><P
>This spec suggests implementing the file manager desktop by mapping a
desktop-sized window (no shape) to all desktops, with
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP.  This makes the desktop focusable and greatly
simplifies implementation of the file manager.  It is also faster than
managing lots of small shaped windows. The file manager draws the background
on this window.  There should be a root property with a window handle for use
in applications that want to draw the background (xearth).

>7.3. Implementing enhanced support for application transient windows</A
></H2
><P
>If the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property is set to None or Root window, the window
should be treated as a transient for all other windows in the same group.  It
has been noted that this is a slight ICCCM violation, but as this behaviour is
pretty standard for many toolkits and window managers, and is extremely
unlikely to break anything, it seems reasonable to document it as standard.

></H2
><P
>	This specification attempts to make reasonable provisions for WM independent pagers and taskbars.  Window Managers that require / desire additional functionality beyond what can be achieved using the mechanisms set out in this specification may choose to implement their own pagers, which communicates with the Window Manager using further, WM-specific hints, or some other means.
	</P

        window using the following guidelines:

><P
>                If either _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER or
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN are set on a window, then the
                pager should not show that window.
              </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                The pager may choose not to display windows with 
                certain semantic types; this spec has no
                recommendations, but common practice is to avoid 
                displaying _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK for example.

>                If the _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER and
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN hints are not present, and the
                window manager claims to support _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
                then the window should be shown if it's in either
                NormalState or IconicState.

><P
>                For window managers that do not support
                _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN, the pager should 
                not show windows in IconicState. These window 
                managers are probably using an older version 
                of this specification.

><P
>Window manager implementors should refer to the ICCCM for definitive
specifications of how to handle MapRequest and ConfigureRequest events.
However, since these aspects of the ICCCM are easily misread, this
document offers the following clarifications:
	</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Window managers MUST honour the win_gravity field of WM_NORMAL_HINTS
   for both MapRequest _and_ ConfigureRequest events [1]
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Applications are free to change their win_gravity setting at any time
		</P
><P
>If application changes its gravity then Window manager should adjust the
reference point, so that client window will not move as the result.
For example if client's gravity was NorthWestGravity and reference point
was
at the top-left corner of the frame window, then after change of gravity to
the SouthEast reference point should be adjusted to point to the
lower-right
corner of the frame.
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>When generating synthetic ConfigureNotify events, the position given
   MUST be the top-left corner of the client window in relation to the
   origin of the root window (i.e., ignoring win_gravity) [2]
		</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>XMoveWindow(w,x,y) behaviour depends on the window gravity. Upon receiving a
request from client application the Window Manager calculates a new reference
point, based on the client window's own size, border width and gravity. For given client
window dimentions (width, height) and border width (bw), the reference point will be
placed at:
