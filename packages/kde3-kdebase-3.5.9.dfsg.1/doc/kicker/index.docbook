<para>
&kicker; is the application launcher panel of the K Desktop Environment.
Besides the <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu, where you can start applications,
&kicker; is also capable of running docked applets like the pager, the
taskbar or the clock, and extensions, such as child panels.
</para>

<para>
&kicker; usually resides on the bottom of the desktop, but it can also
be moved to any other border.  Please report any problems or feature
requests to the &kde; mailing lists.

This is what you see on a freshly installed &kde;, assuming that you
skipped <application>KPersonalizer</application>. If you are using
lower resolution, some of the icons may not appear immediately. To
cater for those smaller resolutions, the screenshot below is divided
in two parts.

<title>A quick tour for new &kde; users</title>

<para>
If you are experienced with this kind of application launcher, you can
ignore this chapter and move on to <link linkend="basics">&kicker;
basics</link>.
</para>

<para>
The main use of &kicker; is starting applications. This is
done by clicking icons, either from the panel or from the
<guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu. &kicker; shows some more things too, so let's
see.
</para>

<para>
Having a look at the screenshots above, there are from left to right:
</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>The <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu</term>
<listitem>
<para>
It is used for launching applications and some other useful
things. Refer to <link linkend="k-menu">The <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu
</link>for more information.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Application start icons</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Here are some icons of commonly used applications. They can be moved and
removed and others can be added. Some of them have a special meaning,
which you can read more about in <link linkend="basics">&kicker;
basics</link>. Resting the mouse over an icon without clicking shows the
name and a short description of that application, if you have set that in
the <link linkend="configuring">Settings Dialog</link>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>The Pager applet</term>

This displays a small view of the virtual desktops. Clicking one section
of it will activate that desktop. Please refer to <link
linkend="applets">Applets</link>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>The Taskbar</term>
<listitem>
<para>
All running applications are displayed as buttons in the
taskbar. Clicking an application's button will bring this application on
top. If it was on top before, it will be iconified. More
information is available in the <link linkend="applets">Applets</link>
section.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>System Tray</term>
<listitem>
<para>
The system tray is able to swallow some kind of applications like - in
this case - &klipper; and the &korganizer; Reminder Daemon. There are
many other applications that dock in the system tray, for example &juk;
and &kopete;. Clicking the icons with the
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> or the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton>
mousebutton performs specific actions defined for each
application.
</para>

will remain in order to fade in &kicker; again.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
This was only the description of &kicker; on its initial launch. It can
be configured in many ways and styles and more applets can be
added. There are even some extensions like the external taskbar you can
add. See <link linkend="basics">&kicker; basics</link>, <link

<title>General usage</title>

<para>
As mentioned before, there are a lot of things that can be added to
&kicker;. This section will tell you everything about application
starting, folder browsing and adding some kinds of applets and
extensions. Lots of things can be done from the context
menu with <guimenuitem>Configure Panel...</guimenuitem> or via the &kcontrolcenter;'s section <menuchoice><guimenu>Desktop</guimenu> <guisubmenu>Panels</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.
</para>

<sect2 id="adding-apps">
<title>Adding applications</title>

<para>
There are three different ways to add an application to &kicker;:
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Drag and Drop</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Simply drag any file from &konqueror; into &kicker; and it's there. Dragging
also works from the <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu with any entry.  You can
change the attributes like optional command line parameters or the icon
by clicking it with the &RMB; and choosing <guimenuitem>Configure 
<replaceable>applicationname</replaceable> Button...</guimenuitem> from the
context menu.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Using the context menu to add a &kde; application</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Click the &RMB; on any free space
in &kicker; and choose <guisubmenu>Add Application to Panel</guisubmenu>.
There you can choose an application
which will then be added to &kicker;.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Using the context menu to add a
non-&kde;-application</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Non-&kde;-applications &eg;
<application>xosview</application> or <application>xemacs</application>.
</para>

<para>
Click the &RMB; on any free space
in &kicker; and choose <guisubmenu>Add Application to
Panel</guisubmenu> and then <guimenuitem>Add Non-KDE
Application</guimenuitem>. In the newly appearing window, enter <guilabel>Button title</guilabel> 
and a <guilabel>Description</guilabel> of the application in the first two text boxes. Then fill 
in the command of the application you
wish to add in the <guilabel>Executable:</guilabel> text box. You can
also append command line arguments, have
the application start from a terminal, and choose the icon which will
appear in &kicker; by clicking the <guiicon>gear</guiicon>. If you don't
choose an icon, the application will use the gear as a default.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
Applications can be moved or removed by &RMB; click and choosing
<guimenuitem>Move <replaceable>application name</replaceable> Button</guimenuitem> or
<guimenuitem>Remove <replaceable>application name</replaceable> Button</guimenuitem>. 
You can also move icons using the &MMB; if you have one. To do this click on an icon using the &MMB;, hold for a second and then drag the icon to its new position.
Another way to remove an application is by clicking the &RMB; on any free space
and then choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Remove from Panel</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Application</guisubmenu></menuchoice> and then the application you want to be
removed.
</para>

<!-- NOTE: Lauri: I'd say it would confuse users if I'd mention Non-KDE-Apps -->
<!-- explicitly here. Please add them if you think there's a need. -->

</sect2>

<sect2 id="adding-folders">
<title>Adding Folders</title>

<para>
Folders can be added by simply dragging a folder to any free space of
&kicker;. Quick Browsers can also be added from the context
menu or the <guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu.
</para>

<para>
There are two different ways to have a folder in &kicker;, you can
choose between them in the menu appearing after dropping.
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><guimenuitem>Add as File Manager &URL;</guimenuitem></term>
<listitem>
<para>Choosing this will add a link to the selected folder. Clicking
this <guiicon>folder</guiicon> icon will open &konqueror; displaying the
contents of this folder. </para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guimenuitem>Add as Quick Browser</guimenuitem></term>
<listitem>
<para>If you add a folder this way, it will be displayed as a submenu of
&kicker;. This submenu contains <guimenuitem>Open in File
Manager</guimenuitem>, which does the same as a file manager &URL;, and
<guimenuitem>Open in Terminal</guimenuitem>, which opens a terminal with
this folder as the working path. Also, this submenu contains the contents of
that folder.  Sub-folders are displayed as new submenus like the Quick
Browser itself. The maximum number of displayed elements can be set in
the <link linkend="configuring">Settings Dialog</link>.
Quick Browsers can also be added from the context menu of
&kicker; and then choosing <guimenuitem>Add Applet to Panel...</guimenuitem> and 
then <guilabel>Special Buttons</guilabel> on the right top of the 
<guilabel>Add Applet</guilabel> dialog.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>

<para>
Both kinds of folders can be moved or removed by &RMB; click and
choosing <guimenuitem>Move <replaceable>application name</replaceable> Button</guimenuitem> or
<guimenuitem>Remove <replaceable>application name</replaceable> Button</guimenuitem>.
You can also move icons using the &MMB; if you have one. To do this click on an icon using the &MMB;, hold for a second and then drag the icon to its new position.
Another way to remove a folder is by clicking the &RMB; on any free space
and then choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Remove from Panel</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Applet</guisubmenu></menuchoice> and then the applet you want to be
removed.
</para>

<para>
File manager &URL;s can also be configured from the
context menu, just like any other folder anywhere in
&kde;.

This section describes the ways &kicker; can be configured. It's only
about the basic &kicker; settings, configuration of the applets are
described in their <link linkend="applets">sections</link>
</para>

<para>
You can change the settings by either clicking
<guimenuitem>Configure Panel...</guimenuitem> in the context
menu of &kicker;, or in &kcontrolcenter; by
going to <guilabel>Desktop</guilabel> and then selecting the
<guilabel>Panels</guilabel> or the <guilabel>Taskbar</guilabel> module.

be adjust its settings rather than that of the Main Panel.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="panel-arrangement">
<title><guilabel>Arrangement</guilabel></title>

<para>
In the <guilabel>Arrangement</guilabel> tab you can configure some basic
functionality of the &kde; panel (&ie; functionality you'd find in other
panel applications as well; later we'll come to the more interesting
features).
</para>

<para>
In the <guilabel>Position</guilabel> frame you can choose which
screen border the panel should be attached to. Please note that usually
the available space is used more efficiently if the panel is aligned
horizontally, &ie; attached to the top or bottom screen border. If you
want to play around with different settings you can change the panel's
position even easier by dragging the panel from one border to the other.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>Length</guilabel> frame lets you define how much space a panel
will occupy on the side of the screen which it resides. By default this is on the
bottom so changing this value will affect a panel's width. The value can be anywhere
from 1% to 100%.
Checking the check box <guilabel>Expand as required to fit contents</guilabel>
makes sure that a panel is at least as big as needed to show every icon and
applet.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>Size</guilabel> frame lets you define how large a panel will be.
The panel's size can be tiny, small, medium, large or custom. Depending on
which applets you use you may find that some applets work better at
different panel sizes.
<!--You can also change the size by clicking the &RMB; on any free space
and choosing a size from the <guimenu>Size</guimenu> menu.-->
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="panel-hiding">
<title><guilabel>Hiding</guilabel></title>

<para>
Depending on your screen resolution you may find that the panel takes
away too much of your precious screen real estate. To save screen space,
the panel offers an auto hide feature. When this feature is enabled, the
panel will hide when the mouse cursor has not been moved over it for a
configurable amount of time. If you move the mouse to the panel's screen
border it will show up again. Select the <guilabel>Hide automatically</guilabel>
option in the <guilabel>Hide Mode</guilabel> frame to enable this feature.
You can also configure the amount of time the panel will wait before
it hides here.  The check box <guilabel>Show panel when switching
desktops</guilabel> makes sure that the panel will be shown on the new
chosen desktop. Otherwise, if there are too many applets and icons on
&kicker;, two small scroll buttons will be displayed to scroll the whole
panel.
</para>

<para>
When the panel's hide buttons are enabled you'll see buttons on both
sides of the panel, with arrows showing to the screen border. If you
click on one of these buttons, the panel will slide away in that
direction.  After that, you'll see a remaining show button in that
corner, which will make the panel show again. Check the appropriate
checkbox if you want the hide buttons to show up on any side of
&kicker;. Using the slider you can change the width of the buttons.
</para>

<para>
You can toggle which hide buttons the chosen panel should have with
the check boxes in the group <guilabel>Panel-Hiding Buttons</guilabel>.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>Panel Animation</guilabel> frame allows you to choose
whether the panel will softly slide away or just disappear.
Checking the <guilabel>Animate panel hiding</guilabel> will allow you
to configure the speed of the animation using the sliders. Unchecking,
naturally, disables the panel animations.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="panel-menus">
<title>Menus</title>

<para>
In the <guilabel>Menus</guilabel> tab you can configure the panel menu's
behavior. This affects the <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu you will often use
to launch applications, the browser menus you can use to access
folders and other menus like the recent documents menu.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>K Menu</guilabel> frame offers you some options to
configure the <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu's functionality. The
<guilabel>Bookmarks</guilabel> and <guilabel>Recent Documents</guilabel> options
will enable submenus showing your <application>konqueror</application>
bookmarks and the last documents you've opened using &kde; applications
respectively. The <guilabel>Quick Browser</guilabel> option will enable a browser menu.
Enabling the <guilabel>Show side image</guilabel> check box will display a neat
image on the left side of the <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu.
The <guilabel>Menu item format</guilabel> entry allows you to set how
detailed the <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu entries will be.
The <guilabel>Name only</guilabel> option simply shows the application's name in the menu.
The <guilabel>Name (Description)</guilabel> option will show a small description
besides the name of the application.
The <guilabel>Description (Name)</guilabel> and <guilabel>Name
(Description)</guilabel> options will show both name and description in
the KMenu.
</para>

<para>
In the <guilabel>QuickBrowser Menus</guilabel> frame you can configure
whether the panel's browser menus will show hidden files or not (hidden
files on &UNIX; systems are those whose filenames begin with a dot) as
well as how many files at most will be shown in a browser menu; the
latter option may be especially useful if you have a rather small screen
resolution, as the browser menus would otherwise quickly fill up your screen
when you browse folders containing many files.
</para>

<para>
The quick start section in the <guimenu>K</guimenu> menu offers quick
access to programs you have used often or recently. In the
<guilabel>QuickStart Menu Items</guilabel> frame you
can choose whether this section will show the most recently or the most
frequently used programs. Using the option <guilabel>Maximum number of
entries</guilabel> you can configure how many
programs the quick start section will remember.

<para>
The check box <guilabel>Enable icon mouseover effects</guilabel>
toggles the large animated tooltips of &kicker;. They show name and
description of the icons and applets the mousepointer is positioned on.
</para>

<para>
If <guilabel>Show tooltips</guilabel> is checked, the classical small
tooltips with descriptions of the icons and applets will be shown if the
mousepointer rests over an icon for some seconds. Note that this
has no effect as long as the option to <guilabel>Enable icon mouseover
effects</guilabel> is enabled.
</para>

<para>
The &kde; panel supports so-called <quote>tiled buttons</quote>. This
means that the buttons shown on the panel will be drawn using
configurable images/colors.
</para>

<para>
For every kind of panel button there is a combo box offering a custom
color option and tiled images. When the value is changed from &quot;Default&quot;,
tiles are enabled for this kind of button. You can also see a preview of a tile
before use via the combo box.

<title>Applets</title>

<para>
Applets are small plugins that extend the panel's functionality. &kde;
comes with some applets but they may be provided by third parties as
well.</para>

<para>
Panel applets can be started using two different ways: internally or
externally. While <quote>internal</quote> is the preferred way to load
applets, this can raise stability or security problems when you are
using poorly programmed third-party applets. To address these problems,
applets can be marked <quote>trusted</quote>. You might want to
configure the panel to treat trusted applets different from untrusted
ones. Your options are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Load only trusted applets internal</guilabel>: All applets but
the ones marked <quote>trusted</quote> will be loaded using an external
wrapper application.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Load startup config applets internal</guilabel>: The applets
shown on &kde; startup will be loaded internally, others will be loaded
using an external wrapper application.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guilabel>Load all applets internal</guilabel>: will
load all applets internally, regardless of whether they are trusted or
not.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
For stability and security reasons, we recommend using one of the first
two options and that you mark only those applets as 'trusted' that come
with the &kde; base packages.
</para>

<para>
To mark applets <quote>trusted</quote> or <quote>untrusted</quote> you
can move them from one of the shown listboxes to the other. Just try
selecting an applet in the list of trusted applets and click the
<guibutton>&gt;&gt;</guibutton> button. This will move the selected
applet to the other list, while clicking the
<guibutton>&lt;&lt;</guibutton> button will move the selected applet of
the list of available applets to the list of trusted ones.

<para>
As you might already guess, the clock applet is a small clock which
resides in &kicker;.
</para>

<para>
A click with the &LMB; on the clock will show a small calendar. You can
use the <guibutton>single arrows</guibutton> to switch the months or the
<guibutton>double arrows</guibutton> for switching years. This won't
have any effect of your date settings, it's just for your information.

<sect1 id="klipper-applet">
<title>&klipper; Applet</title>

<para>
This applet does exactly the same like the &klipper; residing in the system
tray. It has the advantage, that it consumes a little bit less system
resources, which only matters on really slow systems, but has the
disadvantage, that it uses more space than &klipper; in the system
tray. You can read more about that in the manual for
