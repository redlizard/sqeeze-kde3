KControl is organized by "subject" instead of "category".

The idea is that if the user wants to configure something, they should only
have to search for its location in the desktop. Previously, they had to
look for the category of the setting.  It should be apparent that this
isn't very efficient, as the category might be difficult to identify
frequently.

Also, we need to consider that each applet in kcontrol is very busy with
many tabs, and many groups in each tab: this means that our users (and
ourselves!) have to hunt around in several modules until the right
module is found -- and this is in no way easy, seeing that you have to
look at all the tabs.

So, this new organization tries to limit the amount of tabs per module,
and in addition, groups the module by application, rather than topic.

And as an added bonus, it eliminates the Look & Feel group.
