Package: kde3-arts
Architecture: all
Section: sound
Depends: kde3-libartsc0 (>= ${source:Version}), kde3-libarts1c2a (>= ${source:Version})
Description: sound system from the official KDE release
 KDE (the K Desktop Environment) is a powerful Open Source graphical
 desktop environment for Unix workstations. It combines ease of use,
 contemporary functionality, and outstanding graphical design with the
 technological superiority of the Unix operating system.
 .
 This metapackage includes the complete aRts sound system, without
 development packages. aRts is the core sound system for KDE.

Package: kde3-libarts1c2a
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, oss-compat
Recommends: kde3-libarts1-akode
Description: aRts sound system core components
 aRts is a short form for "analog realtime synthesizer". aRts is highly
 modular, creating and processing sound using small modules performing
 specific tasks. These may create a waveform (oscillators), play samples,
 filter data, add signals, perform effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or
 output the data to the soundcard.
 .
 This package contains the aRts sound system, its libraries and binaries,
 including the aRts daemon, artsd.
 .
 The 'akode' package adds several plug-ins to arts that can dramatically
 improve performance and help maintain uninterrupted playback. Its use
 with aRts is recommended.
 .
 This package is part of KDE, and a component of the KDE aRts module.
 See the 'kde' and 'arts' packages for more information.
