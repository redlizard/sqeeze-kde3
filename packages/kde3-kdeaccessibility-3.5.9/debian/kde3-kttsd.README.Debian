    ktts is the KDE Text-to-Speech System.

    more information may be found on the web page of the project:
    http://accessibility.kde.org/developer/kttsd/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

kttsd plugins
=============

    kttsd comes with 3 kind of plugins:
     o AudioPlugins
     o FilterPlugins
     o SynthPlugins

    The synthetizer plugins rely on third party software, that you have to
    install in order to make them fully functional (see kttsd Recommends:
    field).

    That software are :
     o festival for the Festival Plugin.
     o epos for the epos plugin.
     o filte for the FLite plugin.
    They all are packaged in debian.

    There is a Command Plugin also, that allow you to use any TTS synthetizer
    that has a command line interface.

kttsd contrib plugins
=====================

    kttsd comes also with free Synthetizer plugins, but depends upon non free
    software :
     o FreeTTS plugin.
     o Hadifix (mbrola/txt2pho) plugin.
     
    You can find these plugins in the contrib section, in the package
    kttsd-contrib-plugins.

    For additional instructions on downloading and configuring these engines for
    use in KTTS, please read the Appendix A of the kttsd handbook (either type
    help:/kttsd in konqueror, or run khelpcenter help:/kttsd).
