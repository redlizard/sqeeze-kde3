kile for Debian
---------------

Kile no longer comes with a Gnuplot front end. The Gnuplot front end that used
to be part of Kile is now a separate application named Qgfe maintained by
Pascal Brachet at http://www.xm1math.net/qgfe/ .

Syntax files bibtex.xml and latex.xml are provided by kdelibs-data package.
