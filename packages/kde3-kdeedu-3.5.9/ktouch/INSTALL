Retrieving the source
---------------------

After a subversion checkout of the kdeedu module you will automatically have the
ktouch directory inside the kdeedu directory.

If you want to update/checkout ktouch alone, use

    svn checkout -P kdeedu/ktouch
    
or

    svn update -P kdeedu/ktouch

The flag -P is recommanded so that empty directories left over from previous 
versions are not transferred.


Installation from SVN
---------------------

Enter the kdeedu directory and do a 

    make -f Makefile.CVS

and

    ./configure

(don't forget to add your options)

Then change into the subdirectory kdeedu/ktouch and do as usual

    make
    
and/or

    make install


Install is always necessery if the ktouch.rc file has been changed.


Good luck!
