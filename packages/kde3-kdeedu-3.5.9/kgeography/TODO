 - Add the click on map division given its flag
 - Add the fit to window option in the map browsing mode

******************
* Parser related *
******************

 - Add <localname> tag to the map parser/files so the user can see the local name of a division
	Example: In Spanish the user will see for Belgium -> Belgica (due to i18n) and Belgique (due to localname)
 - Add a description saying if divisions are countrys or not as some languages have different words for Capital of a country and for Capital of a region

 - See data/TODO

 - Add more maps ;-)

 - The answers dialog of click on map is really bad

 - Have non political maps, support for geographical (rivers, mountains, etc) is almost there if the map is carefully 
   crafted. Example: Have the map all of the same color, then for each river, mountain, etc create a box big enough 
   of the wanted color and then associate the color of the box with the name of the river, etc.
