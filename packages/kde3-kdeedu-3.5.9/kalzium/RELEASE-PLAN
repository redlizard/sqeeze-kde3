                            Release plan
                            ============

Status: Under discussion


Overview
--------

Currently we plan for 3 releases:

 - A standalone release of Kalzium in August
 - The release for KDE 3.5
 - The release for KDE 4.0

The reason for the standalone release is that we want user feedback
for the KDE 3.5 release.

All details of the release plan are below the TODO items for the
respective release.

Dates

2005-08-07    Feature freeze.  All features in the TODO for
              version Helium should be done at the end of this day.

2005-08-26    End of bug testing and fixing period.

2005-08-30    Release of Kalzium Helium


================================================================
                  Details of the release plan


* Standalone release of Kalzium
  + After one week of testing and improving I would like to release
    Kalzium (together with libkdeedu for the plotting and the glossary) 
	on the 30th of August (a tuesday). Two days later I leave to to
	aKademy in Malaga, Spain.
	
  + Release criteria, prio 1:
    - Fix all bugs on bugs.kde.org
    - *must be* Update edu.kde.org/kalzium with screenshots
    - *must be* increase the version number
  + Release criteria, prio 2:
    - Make the release very usable:
    - Write the documentation
   These prio 2 issues will be prio 1 for KDE 3.5

  + Release mechanism:
    - Announcement on kde-edu@kde.org
    - Announcement on kalzium@kde.org
    - Announcement on www.kde-apps.org
    - Announcement on kde-announce@kde.org
    - I will blog about the release and it goals

* KDE 3.5-release
   + Make use of the feedback we get of the standalone release
   + The 3.5-release will probably be pretty identical with the
     standalone-release, except for bug fixes and usability issues.


* KDE 4-release

  + Port to Qt4. We use a lot QValueList<T> and paintEvents, so I
    expect some fun :)
  + Switch to KCanvas2 so that scaling the table is possible?
    IW: Scaling can be made possible without KCanvas2 as well.
  + Implement the things in the TODO-file
