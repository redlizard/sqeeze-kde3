The KLatin doc comprises several files that are used as online help by the users.
These files are part of the User HandBook.

These files are
- adjectives.docbook
- nouns.docbook
- numbers.docbook
- pronouns.docbook
- verbs.docbook

In these files, the Latin words must not be translated. Only English words are to be translated.
I inserted several comments in order to help the translators.

Please do tell me if anything is not correct or not enough explained.
