<para>On the bottom, two progress bars display your effort. The upper bar shows the ratio 
	of totally attempted exercises. The lower bar compares the
	right with the wrong answers. Do you notice that this is a
	percentage task too? Mistyped inputs (letters, spaces, and so on) have no influence here.

<para> At any time you can leave this window with the
<guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button.  You will be carried back to the
welcome window.  There you can select another type of task or exit
&kpercentage;.</para>

<para> If you press the <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button you are
told whether your input was right or wrong... </para>
