C. Acknowledgements

 KStars is a labor of love.  It started as a personal hobby of mine, but 
 very soon after I first posted the code on Sourceforge, it started to 
 attract other developers.  I am just completely impressed and gratified 
 by my co-developers.  I couldn't ask for a more talented, friendly crew.  
 It goes without saying that KStars would be nowhere near what it is today 
 without their efforts.  Together, we've made something we can all be 
 proud of.

 We used (primarily) two books as a guide in writing the algorithms used
 in KStars:
 + "Practical Astronomy With Your Calculator" by Peter Duffett-Smith
 + "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus

 Thanks to the developers of Qt and KDE whose peerless API made KStars 
 possible.  Thanks also to the tireless efforts of the KDE translation 
 teams, who bring KStars to a global audience.

 Thanks to everyone at the KDevelop message boards and on irc.kde.org,
 for answering my frequent questions.

 Thanks also to the many users who have submitted bug reports or other 
 feedback.

Well, that's about it.  I hope you enjoy KStars!
