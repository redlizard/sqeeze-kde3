1. Bug reports to be resolved:

2. Other Required Fixes:

- Improve opaque ground polygon

- Fix custom catalogs, make it *much* easier to add custom objects.

- UI file for Location dialog (and others?)

- "Engage Tracking" menu/toolbar action jumps to previous tracked object

- INDI device manager: Close button instead of Ok/Cancel

- ExtDatePicker highlights wrong day for year<2000 (correct day selected,
	just highlighting is wrong)

- OpsDialog: zoomed-out faint limit not restricted to be <= zoomed-in limit

- OpsDialog: child widgets should disable when parent deselected:
	   Stars, Asteroids, Comets, CNames, MW, Hide obj.

- OpsDialog: Remove All Trails button does nothing

- OpsDialog: modifying the Hide Objects timestep should trigger Apply button

- AltVsTime: can add custom object more than once, because coords are 
	re-precessed

- Details: Messier object with no long name display M name twice

- Details: "Edit Link" button should allow link text to be changed

- Details: Log window: get rid of Save button; text should silently autosave

- ScriptBuilder: Does not warn if Save As target already exists

- ScriptBuilder: Sometimes, opening a script file sets UnsavedChanges

- Removing a User Label does not cause it to disappear immediately

- Showing star mag label, but not name label, prepends "star" to label
