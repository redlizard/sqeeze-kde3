Description: KDE version of the Simon Says electronic memory game
 Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which
 challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length.  On

 creating the sequence that the player must then recall.  If the
 player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the
 correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical
 sequence with one extra step is presented.
