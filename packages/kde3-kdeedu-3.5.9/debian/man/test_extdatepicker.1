.SH NAME
test_extdatepicker \- GUI-based tests for the ExtDate classes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B test_extdatepicker
[ \fIgeneric-options\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple test program for testing the graphical functionality of
the ExtDate classes.  It presents a KDatePicker widget and an
ExtDatePicker widget side by side for user interaction.
.PP
The \fBExtDate library\fP consists of a group of classes allowing KDE
applications to access calendar dates outside of the limited range of
years imposed by QDate.
.PP
The QDate class has a limited range of valid dates.  It does not
recognize dates prior to 14 Oct 1752 (when the Gregorian calendar
was adopted by England), nor dates after 31 Dec 8000.  Both of these
limits are arbitrary.
.PP
This library is part of the official KDE edutainment module.
.SH OPTIONS
For a full summary of options, run \fItest_extdatepicker \-\-help\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR test_extdate (1).
.PP
See \fI/usr/share/doc/libkdeedu-dev/README.extdate\fP for further
information on this library.
.SH AUTHOR
The ExtDate library was written by Jason Harris <jharris@30doradus.org>
and others.
