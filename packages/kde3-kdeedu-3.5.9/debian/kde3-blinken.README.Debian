Blinken for Debian
------------------

This application provides documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
web browser, see the package kdeedu-doc-html.

The package recommends kcontrol, which contains a plugin needed to
install a custom font used by the game the first time a user runs it.
If you do not install kcontrol, you will need to manually copy the
font steve.ttf from /usr/share/apps/blinken/fonts to a user directory
or to a system directory from where it will be accessible.
