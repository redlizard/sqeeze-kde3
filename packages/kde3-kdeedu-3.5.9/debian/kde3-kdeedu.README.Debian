KDE Educational Applications for Debian
---------------------------------------

Package kdeedu is a metapackage that depends on the full set of
edutainment applications provided with the official release of KDE.

Each application provides documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
web browser, see the package kdeedu-doc-html.
