    This should really be moved to its own binary-indep package soonish.

  +++ Changes by Christopher Martin:

  * Packaging sync with the rest of the team KDE packages. Update
    package descriptions, sync debian-qt-kde.mk and other CDBS
    stuff (should help building on slow architectures).

  * Rather than having packages recommend kdeedu-data, just depend
    on it.

  * Apply the still-relevant kstars/indi part of the kFreeBSD build
    patch (libtool is now updated automatically). (Closes: #326619)

  * Strengthen kiten's Recommends: ttf-kochi-gothic | ttf-kochi-mincho
    to a Depends. (Closes: #372112)

  * Do the same for khangman: remove the copies of Domestic_Manners.ttf
    and Dustismo_Roman.ttf, and instead depend on ttf-dustin.

    Closes: #348644, #348687, #348690, #348692.
  * New patch 10_lib_link.diff: Link libkvoctrain.so against -lkio to
    resolve as many undefined symbols as possible.  Unfortunately, that
    library still needs a couple symbols from the kvoctrain binary itself.
  * Remove obsolete kmessedwords doc-base file.  Closes: #350297.

    a non-debian-specific problem that is already fixed in upstream CVS.

 -- Ben Burton <bab@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Feb 2005 07:53:09 +1100

kdeedu (4:3.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
