        The FITS reading/writing library is released under the GPL.
        This is used in the static libindicom library that is linked
        into KStars.

    Star catalogue:

      Star catalog derived from the Hipparcos and Tycho star catalogs.
      These catalogs are in the public domain, and can be obtained from
      http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/239

      Changes made to the raw catalog include stripping out certain data
      fields, reformatting, and manual matching up common and genetive
      star names.  The modified catalog is (C) Jason Harris, 2003, and is
      licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL):
      http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

      The Hipparcos data is in the public domain and may be used
      by anyone. We do request however that use of the catalogue data
      is acknowledged. Something similar to "This application
      makes use of the  Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues (ESA, 1997)"
      could be appropriate, and a link to the ESA Hipparcos web pages
      (http://sci.esa.int/hipparcos) would also be appreciated.

    Images:

      KStars uses images in the skymap that are under copyright.  
      In most cases, these images are freely available for 
      non-commercial uses.  When required, we have obtained 
      permission from the image's author.  For each image, we 
      credit the author or source and provide a link to their 
      website, when available.
