Reporting a kopete crash
------------------------

When you report a kopete crash, it is important to provide:
 * the exact steps to reproduce the crash (the protocol used, the plugins
   you have activated, the precises circumstances of the bug...)
 * a useful backtrace of the crash

To produce useful backtraces you must have qt-x11-free-dbg, kdelibs-dbg,
and kdenetwork-dbg installed. kdebase-dbg may also be useful. A backtrace
full of "(no debugging symbols found)" is useless.

A bug that is not reproducible, or that lacks the necessary backtrace, will
be discarded.
