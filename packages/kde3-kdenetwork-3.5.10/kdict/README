**************************************************************************

Kdict is a graphical client for the DICT Protocol.
It enables you to search through dictionary-like databases
for a word or phrase, then displays suitable definitions.

Kdict trys to ease basic as well as advanced queries. A separate list
offers a convenient way to deal with the enormous number of matching
words that a advanced query can return.

The remainder of Kdict's user interface resembles a web browser:
For instance, you can jump to the definition of a synonym by
simply clicking on the highlighted word. The back/forward functionality
is also implemented, enabling you to quickly go back to the result of
previous queries.

Kdict is able to  process the content of the X clipboard, so it's easy 
to combine Kdict with your web browser or text editor.

Kdict is now a real client, no additional software is needed.

If your machine is behind a firewall, has no permanent internet
connection or the server of dict.org is too slow for you, you can
set up your own local server, all you need is available at
http://www.dict.org.
The advantages of a local server are optimal performance and
the ability to install additional databases of your choice.
The handbook contains a small tutorial for installation
and links to databases.
