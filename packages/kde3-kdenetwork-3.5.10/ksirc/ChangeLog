	* Fixed problem with "/names" opening a zillion windows and
	joining every channel in existance.

	* toplevel.cpp: re-writting parse-input to do better checking and
 	error handling.  Now uses an internal EString, a QString class
	which emits exceptions on error conditions.  Currently only 1
	exception exists, the estringOutOfBounds exception to indicate
	find returned a value out of the bounds of the string.  Other
	exception handling include failure cases like parse errors.

	* Added better puke support and more widgets.  Currently 8
 	diffrent widgets exist, and 1 layout manager.

	* Nick list sorting works much better, still broken when
	there's only a couple of entries, but it's better.

        * Fixed /names problem.

1998-03-07  Andrew Stanley-Jones  <asj@chowtown.cban.com>

	* Majour update comes in the form of the puke sub directory.  This
 	contains the starting frame work for full control of ksirc from
 	perl scripts.  Right now it implements a small widget set (ha!
  	small!! a widget, a frame and a lineedit).  Ground work is all set
 	to start adding more. :)

	* puke/pwidget.pm (close): Wow it's been a while since this was
 	updated =)

	Channel when last server connection is closed.

	startup settings, etc.

	* ksircprocess/servercontroller/toplevel: Now starts with channel

 	correctly.

1998-01-15  Andrew Stanley-Jones  <asj@chowtown.cban.com>

 	with the last 5 lines!

	* FilterRuleEditor.cpp (moveRule): Fixed error with $$var being
 	nuked.

	* Updated the entire messaging system between ServerController and
 	ksirc process, they can now talk freely without a zillion signals
 	and slots.  Communications is fully bidirectional and should work
 	well.

	* toplevel.cpp (parse_input): Now deals with ssfe#p correctly!!!
 	Finally!!!! (prompts, for say nicks and passwords, try /oper :) )

1998-01-13  Andrew Stanley-Jones  <asj@chowtown.cban.com>

 	instances each will suppy it's rule, and should ONLY be used if

 	single ~. ~~ is always garunteed to print ~.
