KDE Remote Desktop Connection
=============================

KDE Remote Desktop Connection (krdc) is a small VNC-compatible client
that is based on the TightVNC Unix client.  You can use it to access
VNC-compatible servers like KDE's Desktop Sharing (krfb). 

Its focus is on being small and as easy to use as possible. Therefore
it does not have many capabilities that may be useful in classrooms or
for tasks like system administration (like receiving 'broadcasts' of
a remote desktop, viewing several desktops at once, tabs to switch between 
desktops). In the future I plan to make the backend a KPart so that
it is possible to write a more complex clients while sharing code with
krdc.
