TODO
----
* Make KNewsTicker choose one of the rotated modes as soon as Kicker is moved
  to one of the sides.
* Fix the highlighting of the headlines, right now the headlines stay
  highlighted sometimes even if the mouse is moved away (i.e. with the context
  menu)
* Make the "Suggest" function in the news source dialog work for program news
  sources.
* Make it possible to pass parameters to external program newssources.
