Kopete Web Presence Plugin

What It Does
Provides a view of the current state of your contact list as a webpage.

How It Does It
Every so often, it writes a file containing a snapshot of who is online and who is not in your contactlist to a location you specify.  This can be a local file, an FTP server, a HTTP server, or anywhere else that KIO can access.

Use KIO::NetAccess to upload the files!

Getting Info about Local User's Status
Goal is to allow ppl who don't have us on their contactlist to see what our current status is and what our UIN/id is for each protocol.  So we need to know (protocol, uin, status).
