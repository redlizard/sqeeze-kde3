/**
 * @short Provides a means of automatically retrieving, saving and resetting basic settings
 * 
 * The KAutoConfig class provides a means of automatically retrieving,
 * saving and resetting basic settings.  It also can emit signals when
 * settings have been changed (settings were saved) or modified (the
 * user changes a checkbox from on to off).
 *
 * When told to retrieve settings ( retrieveSettings()) KAutoConfig 
 * will traverse the specified widgets building a list of all known widgets
 * that have a name and havn't been marked to be ignored.
 * If a setting is marked immutable the value is loaded and the widget is
 * disabled.
 *
 * The name of the widget determines the name of the setting.  The initial
 * value of the widget also is the default value when the widget is reset.
 * If the widget does not have a name then it is ignored.
 *
 * When saveSettings() or resetSettings() is called KAutoConfig
 * goes through the list of known widgets and performs the operation on each
 * of them.
 *
 * If one of the widgets needs special treatment it can be specified to be
 * ignored using the ignoreSubWidget() function.  
 *
 * KAutoConfig uses the QSqlPropertyMap class to determine if it can do
 * anything to a widget.  Note that KAutoConfig doesn't  require a database,
 * it simply uses the functionality that is built into the QSqlPropertyMap
 * class.  New widgets can be added to the map using  
 * QSqlPropertyMap::installDefaultMap().  Note that you can't just add any
 * class.  The class must have a matching Q_PROPERTY(...) macro defined.
 * 
 * For example (note that KColorButton is already added and it doesn't need to 
 * manually added):
 *
 * kcolorbutton.h defines the following property:
 * \code
 * Q_PROPERTY( QColor color READ color WRITE setColor )
 * \endcode
 *
 * To add KColorButton the following code would be inserted in the main.
 * 
 * \code
 * QSqlPropertyMap *map = QSqlPropertyMap::defaultMap();
 * map.insert("KColorButton", "color");
 * QSqlPropertyMap::installDefaultMap(map);
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you add a new widget to the QSqlPropertyMap and wish to be notified when
 * it is modified you should add its signal using addWidgetChangedSignal().
 * If the Apply and Default buttons and enabled/disabled by KAutoConfigDialog
 * automatically then this must be done.
