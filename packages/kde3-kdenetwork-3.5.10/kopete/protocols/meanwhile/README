This is a kopete plugin for meanwhile using the libmeanwhile library.

To INSTALL
==========

1. install libmeanwhile
2. install kopete with the meanwhile plugin.

installing libmeanwhile
=======================
from http://meanwhile.sf.net - use version 0.3
Refer to INSTALL in the meanwhile code. Run configure without specifying the --with_gaim_src
 # autogen.sh
 # ./configure --prefix=/usr
 # make
 # su -c make install

installing kopete with meanwhile plugin
=======================================
1. Get kopete src from kopete.kde.org (latest cvs)
2. move this directory to $KOPETE_SRC/kopete/protocols/meanwhile,
3. patch the configure script in $KOPETE_SRC to pickup meanwhile
        in $KOPETE_SRC
        # patch -P0 < kopete/protocols/meanwhile/configure.patch
4. patch Makefile.am in protocols with protocols-makefile.patch
        in $KOPETE_SRC
        # patch -P0 < kopete/protocols/meanwhile/protocols-makefile.patch
5. run automake to process this Makefile.am
        in $KOPETE_SRC
        # automake kopete/protocols/Makefile
6. libmeanwhile uses glib and kopete's makefile have no references to glib, so
   edit $KOPETE_SRC/kopete/protocols/meanwhile/Makefile.am and verify that
   GLIB_INCLUDES points to the right places. These variables are currently
   set for Fedora-core-1. If you have to modify the variable, rebuild the
   makefile.
        in $KOPETE_SRC
        # automake kopete/protocols/meanwhile/Makefile
7. follow the steps defined in kopete INSTALL:
        on fedora/redhat this could be (from $KOPETE_SRC)
        # ./configure --prefix=/usr/
        # make
        # make install
7.1 if you want to install only meanwhile on an existing copy of kopete, 
        after the make, try make install in 
                $KOPETE_SRC/kopete/protocols/meanwhile
      
8. enjoy*.

* Hopefully i have fixed this, but when you try to add accounts and you 
donot find meanwhile listed, copy kopete/protocols/meanwhile/kopete_meanwhile.desktop 
to $KDE_DIR/share/services (/usr/share/services on fedora).
* If you find the icons for meanwhile missing, overwrite Makefile in 
    kopete/protocols/meanwhile/icons with Makefile.siva
