Qt Cryptographic Architecture
-----------------------------
Version: API v1.0, Plugin v1
Author: Justin Karneges <justin@affinix.com>
Date: September 10th 2003

This library provides an easy API for the following features:

  SSL/TLS
  X509
  SASL
  RSA
  Hashing (SHA1, MD5)
  Ciphers (BlowFish, 3DES, AES)

Functionality is supplied via plugins.  This is useful for avoiding
dependence on a particular crypto library and makes upgrading easier,
as there is no need to recompile your application when adding or
upgrading a crypto plugin.  Also, by pushing crypto functionality into
plugins, your application is free of legal issues, such as export
regulation.

And of course, you get a very simple crypto API for Qt, where you can
do things like:

  QString hash = QCA::SHA1::hashToString(blockOfData);

Have fun!
