If you can bear with beta-quality code, we welcome you to try out this
highly improved plugin and use it as your primary instant messaging system!
Patches are always welcome on kopete-devel@kde.org. Trivial fixes can be
committed directly to KDE CVS if you have an account, but please coordinate
larger changes with us to avoid double work.

Thanks for your interest in Kopete!

RELEASE NOTES FOR THE MSN PLUGIN IN KOPETE 0.5

Most of the MSN plugin has seen an enormous improvement since the previous
release, with many bugs fixed in all aspects of the plugin, most notably
the contact list handling and group chats. See the Changelog for a more
detailed description of what was changed in this release.

Some issues in MSN are still remaining though. We hope to fix them in the
next release, since we think they are not critical enough to delay this
release:

- MSN allows you to have multiple groups with the same name, because
  internally a group ID is used. Kopete currently uses the name as a unique
  identifier, however, and will likely get a bit confused by this. If you
  do experience problems, you could join both groups using another MSN
  client, like the official client, Trillian or Gaim as a workaround.

- Kopete contacts can be at Top-Level and in no groups. MSN doesn't
  support this freature. The kopete's contact list can differe from server 
  if you have top-level contact
