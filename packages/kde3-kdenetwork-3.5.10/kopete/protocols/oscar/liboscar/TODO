This is the TODO file for liboscar. Please note that this TODO file is on a
very short timeframe since the goal is to have liboscar done before KDE 3.4.
Realistically, KDE 4 is a better goal, but i want to push hard for KDE 3.4

If you're going to be looking at the docs, I suggest downloading the zip file (click the download link) from iserverd.khstu.ru/oscar for
faster loading.

Misc. Before Merge things
====================================

- Don't hardcode the values in SendDCInfoTask. Find a way to get them from the account or something.
- Rename SendDCInfoTask to SendExtInfoTask (rename the files on the server too. contact sysadmin@kde.org to see about this. It may have to wait until the merge)
- Check capabilities handling (the code is from oscarsocket, we need to make sure it will still work ok for liboscar until we come up with something better)
- Test moving contacts from one group to another


Direct Connections
====================================
When/If we get around to it. Matt knows absolutely nothing about direct connections and the only online source of documentation is no longer online. :(
This will definately be one of those things we have to dissect gaim for. :/


SNAC 0x15 parsing
====================================

SNAC 0x15 parsing is done. however parts may need to be reworked as things have gotten
very messy. we currently don't do a good job of handling extra data (i.e. i can't call
addInitialData with just the initial data and get the type 1 tlv length right. maybe a
prepareSend( const Buffer& ) function that adds the type one tlv to our packet so we 
get the tlv length right.

also, we may want to implement a removeInitialData function that we can call if the packet
is for us so we don't have to have code in all the icq tasks that get rid of the initial tlv
data that we parse in parse initial data.
