===========================

This list is too long too mention. If you want to have an idea of all the
various contributions we've got, please check the CVS commit logs. If we
would attempt to list the people here other people would surely be forgotten
and feel left out.

Let's leave it at telling you that several hundreds of people have
contributed code, helpful information, documentation, translations or
useful bug reports to Kopete, making Kopete what it is now.

If you contributed to Kopete, you know who you are, and many thanks for
the work you've done!
