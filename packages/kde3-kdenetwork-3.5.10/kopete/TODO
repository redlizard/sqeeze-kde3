These are random snippets that should give developers a clue of what we have
to fix before the next release.

Beware: It's totally unsorted ;)

================================================================================
- Once and for all fix the way displayName is used in KopeteContact. With
  serverside contact lists it's now impossible to rename contacts on the server
  because some people (e.g. Olivier) want to see the nickname that a user
  assigned and others (e.g. Martijn) want to ALWAYS see the display name of the
  meta contact.
  displayName and nickName should be split and depending on the user's prefs
  displayName() should return either MC->displayName() or nickName().

- Add a way to detect when a protocol goes offline involuntary. In that case
  try a reconnect first and only leave the protocol offline if the reconnect
  fails. Alternatively, retry reconnecting with increasing intervals.
  -> PARTLY DONE, see KopeteAccount::disconnect() functions

- Prevent attempting to send while offline where appropriate

- First time wizard

- Save the account order in the config file (IMPORTANT)

- Interface for application invitations, and better filetransfers support

- KAB integration
  -> DONE?

OSCAR ICQ/AIM TODO ITEMS

	OSCAR in general========================================================
	- somehow sync server and local list, this is not as trivial as everybody
	  always thinks it is because you cannot sure if local changes or
	  serverside-changes caused the difference (think about two clients being used
	  for the same account, one at home and one at work).
	  Update: Actually it might be possible by saving two timestamp/size values
	  for the account. Serverside and local values.
	  Also I'm much in favor of hindering the user from offline editing the
	  contactlist.
	X save groupID in KopeteGroups
	X make renaming serverside contacts possible
	  (should work if kopete groupname == serverside groupname)
	X Base Buffer class on something like QDataStream (if possible),
	  I don't like all the pointer stuff in here
	X get rid of AIMContactList, AIMBuddy (almost gone already) and AIMGroup.

	ICQ specific ===========================================================
	X support simple icq type-2 messages so we can send/receive away
	  messages (yes, I even see this as a point for not releasing 0.7, away
	  messages ARE important or else I could take out away modes altogether)
	X prevent passwords longer than 8 chars, it upsets the server
	- general support for SNAC (0x15,y)
	X read away reasons
	X own away-reasons
	- Support RTF
	X honor encodings for both sides (done but incomplete)
	- Option: Allow access from contacts on my contact list only
	- group handling
	  (signals: KopeteMetaContact::movedToGroup, addedToGroup, removedToGroup)
	  I'm not sure what this item means, none of the other protocols listen to
	  these signals.
	- ignore lists (needs proper group-handling)
	- invisible list (needs proper group-handling)
	- support sending all of your own icq userinfo to the server,
	  it's easy to do but a lot of of boring work

	AIM specific ===========================================================
	- Nothing in here yet, I'd appreciate somebody with more extensive use
	  of AIM to take over just that part of the plugin.


================================================================================


 MSN TODO  (for the Kopete 1.0 release)
---------------------------------------

	- Handle the MSN PLUS! color codes
	- Show internals messages in chat window when filetransfers (go with
	  the new interface for invitation in libkopete)

	- Search for an MSN User (not for Kopete 1.0)

================================================================================
