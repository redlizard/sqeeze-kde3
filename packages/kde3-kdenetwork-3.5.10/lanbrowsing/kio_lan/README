This is a brandnew ioslave for my brandnew LISa daemon/server.
It provides something like a network neighbourhood
only relying on the TCP/IP protocol stack for KDE. Enter lan:/ to see it.
Read the README for lisa/reslisa.
LISa/resLISa is in the subdir lisa/.
Maybe you have to adjust the Makefile a little bit, it currently doesn't
use the automake/configure stuff.
On some systems (e.g. Solaris) you will have to add some libraries, like
-lnsl, I think.

Copy this directory e.g. under kdebase/kioslave and enter it in
kdebase/kioslave/Makefile.am in the SUBDIR line. The rerun make in
kdebase/kioslave.
