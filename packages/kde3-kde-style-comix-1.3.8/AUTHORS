   Drawing routines completely reimplemented from KDE3 HighColor, which was
   originally based on some stuff from the KDE2 HighColor.

The window decoration is also derived from the "Plastik" and "Knifty"
code skeleton by Sandro Giessl. I am afraid i do not have any copyright 
history for this, for it is taken from the KDE CVS tree. Big Thanks to 
Sandro anyhow.
