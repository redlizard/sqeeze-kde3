Package: kde3-kdelibs
Section: libs
Architecture: all
Depends: kde3-kdelibs4c2a (>= ${binary:Version}), kde3-kdelibs-data (>= ${source:Version})
Description: core libraries from the official KDE release
 KDE (the K Desktop Environment) is a powerful Open Source graphical
 desktop environment for Unix workstations. It combines ease of use,
 contemporary functionality, and outstanding graphical design with the
 technological superiority of the Unix operating system.
 .
 This metapackage includes the core KDE libraries, binaries, and data,
 needed by virtually all KDE applications. It does not include
 development files.

Package: kde3-kdelibs-data
Section: libs
Architecture: all
Depends: hicolor-icon-theme
Replaces: libdjvulibre1
Conflicts: kdelibs-data
Description: core shared data for all KDE applications
 This package contains all the architecture independent data files
 commonly used by KDE applications. You need these data files to run
 KDE applications.
 .
 This package is part of KDE, and a component of the KDE libraries module.
 See the 'kde' and 'kdelibs' packages for more information.

Package: kde3-kdelibs4c2a
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, kde3-kdelibs-data, menu-xdg, perl, x11-xserver-utils, xauth
Suggests: fam, perl-suid, ghostscript
Conflicts: kdelibs4c2a
Description: core libraries and binaries for all KDE applications
 This package contains all the shared libraries and common core binaries
 used by all KDE applications. You need these libraries and binaries to
 run KDE applications.
 .
 Several scripts included in kdebase-bin, related to the handling of SMB
 and NFS shares, require the perl-suid package to work properly.
 .
 If you are working with remote filesystems, you may find that fam
 is helpful in tracking filesystem updates. If you work only with local
 filesystems, then avoid fam (and gamin), since if they are not installed,
 KDE will use its own more efficient inotify (or else dnotify) system
 directly.
 .
 This package is part of KDE, and a component of the KDE libraries module.
 See the 'kde' and 'kdelibs' packages for more information.
