Reporting bugs for KDE packages
-------------------------------

KDE does not support beeing upgraded while running. If you do so, you may
encounter weird bugs (empty menus or configuration dialogs e.g.), and even
crashes.

If you recently upgraded kdelibs and/or kdebase packages, please consider:
 * exiting your current KDE session.
 * ensuring that no more KDE process is still running, especially the processes
   named (list beeing non-limitative): dcopserver, kded, ksmserver...
 * log in KDE again.

Then try to reproduce you bug. If it's not reproducible, then please do not
report it.
