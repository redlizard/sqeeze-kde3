.TH KLAUNCHER 1 "Jun 2006" "K Desktop Environment" "service activation daemon"
.SH NAME
klauncher
\- daemon for service activation in KDE
.SH DESCRIPTION
!!! \fBklauncher\fP is started automatically by kdeinit. It is not supposed to be started manually. !!!
.sp 1
\fBklauncher\fP is a daemon responsible for service activation in KDE. It operates closely together with the kdeinit master process to start new processes. KDE applications communicate with \fBklauncher\fP via DCOP to start new applications or services.
.sp 1
The error message "KLauncher could not be reached via DCOP" either indicates a serious problem with the \fBdcopserver\fP or \fBklauncher\fP crashed.
.sp 1
Note: \fBklauncher\fP is not the "run command" dialog (Alt+F2)!
