.TH KDEINIT 1 "Jun 2006" "K Desktop Environment" "process launcher"
.SH NAME
kdeinit
\- KDE process launcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkdeinit\fP [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkdeinit\fP is a process launcher similar to \fBinit\fP used for booting UNIX.
.sp 1
\fBkdeinit\fP is used to start all other KDE programs. It can start binary program files as well as kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs).
.sp 1
When \fBkdeinit\fP starts for the first time it launches \fBdcopserver\fP, \fBklauncher\fP, \fBkded\fP and some additional programs specified on its command line in the \fBstartkde\fP script (normally \fBkcminit\fP and \fBknotify\fP).
.sp 1
The \fBkdeinit\fP master process can be used to start additional KDE programs via \fBkdeinit_wrapper\fP, \fBkshell\fP and \fBkwrapper\fP.
.sp 1
KLMs are dynamic libraries that work like binary programs but can be started more efficiently.
Starting KLMs via \fBkdeinit\fP is much faster and more memory efficient because \fBkdeinit\fP is linked against all libraries a standard KDE application needs. To start a KLM \fBkdeinit\fP forks and loads the dynamic library.
