.TH KSTARTUPCONFIG 1 "Jun 2006" "K Desktop Environment" "configuration options loader"
.SH NAME
kstartupconfig, kdostartupconfig
\- KDE configuration options loader
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkstartupconfig\fP [$KDEHOME]
.sp 1
\fBkdostartupconfig\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBkstartupconfig\fP loads configuration options for use in \fBstartkde\fP. It saves loading time as there is no need to launch programs linked to KDE libraries. \fBstartupconfig\fP uses a cache of some Kconfig options that are updated by \fBkdostartupconfig\fP. The cache is implemented as script file that is sourced and provides the options as shell variables.
.sp 1
The configuration options to load are stored in \fIstartupconfigkeys\fP as one option per line. They follow the format <file> <group> <key> <default>. A complete group is addressed as <file> [<group>]. The configuration options are processed in the specified order so the missing default values for groups can be specified as single options after the group option.
.sp 1
\fBkstartupconfig\fP stores every line from \fIstartupconfigkeys\fP in \fIstartupconfigfiles\fP followed by the paths of all files relevant to the option. Lines with non\-existent files start with '!' in case they are created later. The list of files is terminated by a line starting with '*'.
.sp 1
If the timestamps of all relevant files are older than the timestamp of \fIstartupconfigfile\fP there is no need to update anything. Otherwise \fBkdostartupconfig\fP is launched to create or update the necessary files.
.sp 1
\fBkdostartupconfig\fP writes values of the options to \fIstartupconfig\fP. \fIstartupconfig\fP is a shell script that sets the values to shell variables. The variables are named <file>_<group>_<key>.
.sp 1
\fBNotes:\fP
.IP "     \-"
the \fIkdeglobals\fP config file is not used as a dependency for other config files
.IP "     \-"
do not use frequently changed config files since the checking is timestamp\-based
.IP "     \-"
if \fBkconf_update\fP is used to update an option also touch the matching global config file to allow \fBkstartupconfig\fP to see changes
