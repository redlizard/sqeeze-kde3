This example shows the use of KMdi.
Either you inherit your views from KMdiChildView or you wrap your common widgets by KMdiChildViews.
Your main widget must inherit from KMdiMainFrm.



Call
  qmake kFourChildren -o Makefile
  make
to build the example app.
Likely you must set the environment variable KDEDIR (to e.g. /opt/kde3).
