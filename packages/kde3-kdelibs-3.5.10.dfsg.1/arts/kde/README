libartskde Introduction
-----------------------

1. What is libartskde?
libartskde is a simple KDE->aRts wrapper
that allows the developer to use KDE
technology to access aRts.
ie. no need to deal with std::string's anymore
etc.. you can just use QString's or KURL's
to play sound

2. How to use it to play sounds?
<snip>
1	KArtsDispatcher dispatcher;
2	KArtsServer server;

3	KURL file = "file:/home/nikoz/test.mp3";

4	KPlayObjectFactory factory(server.server());
5	KPlayObject *playobj = factory.createPlayObject(file, true);

6	playobj->play();
<snap>

Line:
1	Sets up the a KArtsDispatcher
2	Starts a new SoundServerV2 in the running artsd process

3	Simple test URL to demonstrate the use with KURL

4	Creates a KPlayObjectFactory, parameter: our SoundServerV2
5	Gets a KPlayObject from the factory, containing an Arts::PlayObject
	created in our running artsd process
	Parameters:
		KURL url
			(specifies the url to be played)
		bool createBUS
		 	(specifies wheter to create a Synth_BUS_UPLINK or not, "false" is only interesting if you want to use EffectsStacks etc..., see Noatun)
6	Play the file

That's it, with 6 LOC a "full" media player :)

To make the example above compile you will also have to add these #includes:
#include <arts/kartsserver.h>
#include <arts/kartsdispatcher.h>
#include <arts/kplayobject.h>
#include <arts/kplayobjectfactory.h>

Enjoy...
