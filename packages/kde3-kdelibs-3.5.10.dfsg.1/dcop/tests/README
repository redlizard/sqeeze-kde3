WHAT IS IT
==========

This is a test case for the dcop family of utils.


HOW TO USE IT
=============

testcases is the important file, the rest is build system.
It details what functions we should generate and with what arguments to call them

'make'ing will generate a small dcop app which runs in two modes: the batch mode and the
interactive mode. The batch mode simply runs all the tests inside the app, while in the interactive
mode, the app goes to sleep and exactly the same tests are called from the outside. Should the results
differ, we probably have a bug.


HOW IT WORKS
============

Six files get generated:

                             local               external           shell
                       +-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
                       |                   |                 |                 |
   stdout              |   batch.stdout    |   dcop.stdout   |  shell.stdoud   |
                       |                   |                 |                 |
                       +-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
                       |                   |                 |                 |
   return values       |   batch.returns   |   dcop.returns  |  shell.returns  |
                       |                   |                 |                 |
                       +-------------------+-----------------+-----------------+

The local column are the files generated in batch mode where the calls are made locally, the external and shell columns lists files made using dcop calls, "external" calls were made through an external program and shell call were made using the dcop shell client. The stdout row is what got printed to stdout and the returns row is what return values the various functions support. These are kept separate to simplify things.
