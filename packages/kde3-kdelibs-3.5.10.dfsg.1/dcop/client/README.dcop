Overview of dcop command line utilities

dcop [<app-id> [<object-id> [<function> [args]]]]

Make a dcop call to the specified function.
If no function is specified, a list of available functions is listed.
If no object is specified, a list of available objects is listed.
If no app-id is specified, a list of available application-ids is listed.

****
* As of KDE 3.0: You will NO LONGER be able to use "dcop konqueror" to 
* communicate with e.g. "konqueror-4783". You will have to use "dcop 
* konqueror-4783" for that (or the DCOPRef notation, see below)
****

dcopstart <app>

Starts <app> and returns  the <app-id> on stdout that can be used for the 
other commands. E.g. "dcopstart kedit" might return "kedit-29322". An 
exit-code of '0' means success. An exit-code of '1' means error, the error 
msg is printed to stderr and no data is printed to stdout.


dcopfind [-l] [-a] <app-id> [<object-id> [<select_func> [args]]]

Finds an existing DCOP application/object. The select_func can be used to 
select a specific single instance out of many based on some criteria. 
<app-id> and <object-id> may end with a '*' as wildcard.

The function returns a <app-object-id> to stdout in the form

   "DCOPRef(<app-id>, <object-id>)" 

if an object is found and returns an exit-code of '0'. 
If no object is found, nothing is written to stdout and the exit-code is '1'.

With the -a option it prints out "<app-id>" instead of a DCOPRef.

With the -l option it calls "dcopstart <app-id>" if no object is found, 
stripping off any wildcard from the <app-id>. If the dcopstart command is 
successful the find command is repeated, if the dcopstart command fails, an 
error message is printed to stderr and the command exits with exit-code '2'.

The default selection criteria is "any". Applications can declare their own 
select_func as they see fit, e.g. konqueror could declare 
"isDoingProtocol(QString protocol)" and then the following command would 
select a konqueror mainwindow that is currently handling the help-protocol:

   "dcopfind 'konqueror*'  'konqueror-mainwindow*' 'isDoingProtocol(QString 
protocol)' help"


dcop <dcopref> <function> args

In addtion to the current syntax of

   dcop <appid> <object> <function> args

you will now also be able to use <dcopref> to make calls with <dcopref> being 
"DCOPRef(<appid>, <objectid>)" as returned by dcopfind.

Additional utilities:

	"dcopref <appid> <object>"

Creates a DCOPRef from appid and object.


	"dcopclient <dcopref>"

Extracts the appid from dcopref.


	"dcopobject <dcopref>"

Extracts the object from dcopref.
