3rdparty source code

Contents:
- zlib/
- bzip2/

You need to download and unpack source code here and build it 
or at least put here necessary header files.

Optionally you can also get binaries and copy include files to above
directories.

You can give up with touching zlib diectory at all if your Qt library
contains zlib.
