Checklist to ensure that zeroconf will work:

1) Install Apple's mdnsd, at least version 85
2) kdelibs (and kdebase for ksysguard) should be configured and compiled with dns_sd sdk (part
of mdnsd installation) present - config.h should contain '#define HAVE_DNSSD 1'
3) check /etc/nsswitch.conf and ensure that there is 'mdns' before 'dns' in
line starting with 'host:'. It should be something like:
host: files mdns dns
4) ensure that mdnsd is being started in initscripts
5) for testing: use kpf kicker applet to publish a directory, then open 'zeroconf:/'
URL in konqueror. You should be able to see a local webserver with that published dir.
