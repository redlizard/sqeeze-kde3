BUGS
----

- Administration of remote printers: driver settings

- Allow to view a set of specified printers in the job viewer
  (instead of "one or all").


WISHES
------

- Implement a generic banner behavior: banners would be insrted
  as standard print file before and/or after the actual file. This
  would allow for KDE-specific banners and translated banners.

- Possibility to specify a different input slot for first page???

- add "Subject" or "Regarding" to kdeprintfax interface: look first
  if this is possible in efax and/or hylafax

- add the possibility to view a printjob file (if possible)

- restarting server: use of "ps" in a subshell to get the pid, possibility
  of authentification (put this into separate program that would restart
  itself using kdesu).

- CUPS: a "Printer/Server Debugging Helper" would be nice: you could 
  vary the LogLevel there, restart the server, provide a viewer
  for the error_log (maybe the other logs too) with life updates
  including means to "grep" for errors and keywords. It could even
  become extended to provide for some automatic reporting tool that
  collects the data to be send in for bug reports (like PPD in use,
  CUPS version, KDEPrint version, printer-make-and-modell, usage
  of foomatic/cupsomatic, ghostscript version etc.).	-kp-

- log viewer: page_log, error_log, ... This could be based on XML
  templates and produce printable HTML reports.

- in CUPS possibility to filter printer using printer-type attribute,
  to get only printers having a specified capability. Service Location
  Protocol might be useful here (perhaps via the Knot).

- show information from Foomatic DB in some way (comments)

- "Save as new instance" possibility in the print dialog

- raw printing option

- add a generic option edit line to let the user specify any option
  he wants

- support new options for N-up printing in CUPS, put everything in
  a separate page with graphical widgets, and replace the N-up zone
  of the "General" page with Color/GrayScale.

- allow to set the job title in kprinter

- preview multi files sequentially

- support for ICC (have a look at GS-7.05 that support ICC)

- accessing Fax settings from "Fax" printer configuration dialog??

- allow extracting PPD files from exe (like those from Adobe) using
  the cabextract utility http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php3

- cupsaddsmb: allow downloading/extracting the Adobe PS driver package
  using cabextract utility. Note: in cups-1.1.16, a free Windows
  driver should be included, such that Adobe drivers won't be needed
  anymore.
