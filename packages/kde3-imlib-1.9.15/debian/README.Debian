		Imlib Version 11
		----------------

Imlib11 is linked with libpng12, which began life as libpng3.  This is
in accordance with the practice of Redhat.  The GDK version of imlib,
being part of GNOME 1, has remained linked with libpng2.

No library that links with this version of Imlib may also link with
libpng2.

No application that links with this version of Imlib may link with
libpng2, neither directly nor through a third library.

If you accidentally link an application with imlib and libpng2, the
application may behave in unpredictible ways, possibly crashing,
possibly emitting warnings similar to the following:

  libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.2.1
  libpng warning: Application  is running with png.c from libpng-1.0.12
  libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library



		Imlib Version 1
		---------------

Imlib1 and gdk-imlib1 are compiled against libpng2.  If you need to
build with libpng2, install the package imlib1-dev or gdk-imlib1-dev
as appropriate.


		The Palette File
		----------------

The system Imlib/Gdk-Imlib palette file was moved from the directory
`/etc/im' to `/etc/imlib'.  This move may cause problems for users who
have a `.imrc' file in their home directory since that file may
contain a reference to the old location of the palette file.  To
correct this problem, the "PaletteFile" entry should look like:

        PaletteFile /etc/imlib/im_palette.pal

I believe this changed happened in late 1999.
