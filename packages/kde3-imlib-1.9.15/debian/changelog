  * QA upload.

  [ Michel DÃ¤nzer ]
  * Fix incorrect rendering when the MIT-SHM extension doesn't support shared
    pixmaps, e.g. using EXA with current versions of Xorg:
    + the boolean value returned via the last parameter to XShmQueryVersion()
      isn't honoured everywhere
    + the init functions that take parameters allow the caller to enable
      shared pixmaps when they aren't supported (or disabled by configuration
      files)
    Closes: #448360.

  * No longer any need to define "-DNO_INIT_MSG."  It no longer appears
    to be used in the Imlib/gdk-imlib sources.
  * Wildcarded the glob expression for the shared libraries listed in
    imlib1.files.in and gdk-imlib1.files.in so that libraries with
    revisions that have more than one digit (e.g. 1.9.10 vs 1.9.8.1)
    will be installed.  Thanks to  "Eric Gillespie, Jr."
    <epg@pobox.com> for pointing out the problem and suggesting a fix.
  * Install the pkgconfig files for both the Imlib and the gdk_imlib
    libraries in the `/usr/lib/pkgconfig' directory.  Unlike the
    imlib-config script, each file has been placed in its
    corresponding "-dev" package.

imlib (1.9.8-4) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed broken imlib-base.preinst script.  It didn't check if
    /etc/imlib/imrc existed prior to running egrep on it.  This resulted
    in an empty /etc/imlib directory when upgrading.  If the directory is
    empty then recreate the missing files.  (#60048, #60052)

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Mar 2000 15:34:40 -0800

imlib (1.9.8-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Created a simple manual page for imlib_config program. (#39462)

imlib (1.9.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated dependencies for imlib1 and gdk-imlib1 so that imlib-base gets 
    updated.  Previously, the old 1.8.1 imlib-base package wouldn't get
    updated to the 1.9.4 package since there was no explicit dependency on 
    the new package.  The new package is needed due to the conffile move
    from /etc/im to /etc/imlib.
  * Added informative message to the imlib-base preinst script about the
    conffile move to /etc/imlib.
  * #ifdefed out the "Imlib Init" message in `Imlib/misc.c'.  It appears
    that I accidentally lost the original patch during my imlib
    updates. (#39122)
  * Corrected spelling in README file.  (#38876)

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jun 1999 15:12:28 -0500

    or higher.

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Apr 1999 13:39:38 -0500

imlib (1.9.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved conffile location from /etc/im to /etc/imlib.
  * Made /etc/imlib/* conffiles.  It appears that the original conffile
    in the control area somehow got lost so I created one.

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Apr 1999 12:36:10 -0500

imlib (1.9.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed libgtk-dev from the dependency list to prevent libgtk-dev 1.0
    from being used to fulfill the dependency.  It should depend on
    libgtk1.2-dev.

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 22:01:33 -0500

imlib (1.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated gdk-imlib-dev dependency information to use gtk1.2-dev instead
    of gtk1.1-dev.  Thanks to Paolo Molaro <lupus@lettere.unipd.it> for
    pointing this out.

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Feb 1999 15:41:33 -0600

imlib (1.9.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved imlib.m4 back to imlib-dev from imlib-base to make everyone happy,
    although I believe this to be the incorrect solution. 

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Feb 1999 15:13:55 -0600

imlib (1.9.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the `libimlib-*' libraries to their corresponding gdk-imlib
    packages.  They didn't belong in the Imlib packages.
  * Moved `libimlib-*.so' to the gdk-imlib1 run-time library package since
    the links are needed for run-time operation not compile time operation.
    This fixes the gdk_imlib image loading problem.  (#33630)

 -- Ossama Othman <ossama@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Feb 1999 16:36:40 -0600

imlib (1.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer upload.
  * New upstream release.
  * Patched ltconfig to support non-i386 platforms:
        check_shared_deplibs_method=\
             'file_magic ELF [0-9][0-9]-bit [ML]SB shared object'
    instead of:
        check_shared_deplibs_method=\
             'file_magic ELF 32-bit LSB shared object'
  * The below fix also fixes the wmakerconf/imlib problem (#32661), it seems.
  * Added @PREFIX@/lib/libimlib-*.so and @PREFIX@/lib/libimlib-*.a to
    imlib-dev.files.in so that the `.so' links to the individual image
    type Imlib shared libraries and their corresponding static libraries
    get installed.  They were not added after Imlib was split into several
    libraries.
  * Created man page for imlib-config.
  * Created dhelp file to register Imlib programmers' guide found in
    imlib-base with dhelp (#31189)
  * Added rules to patch libtool after the configure script builds it
    so that an rpath isn't built into the libraries.
    (patch description available in lintian package)
  * Updated Standards-Version in control.in to 2.5.0.0.
  * Now lintian clean.
