		Imlib Image Conversion
		----------------------

The imlib and gdk-imlib libraries have a number of built-in image
conversion routines, and are capable of loading or saving in *at
least* the following formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PS, BMP, XPM, and
PPM.

Prior to version 1.9.13, imlib and gdk-imlib could use an external
program, such as Imagemagick's "convert", to load or save images
in formats not handled internally to Imlib.  



		"All fallbacks failed."
		-----------------------

This message indicates that the file you wished to load is not handled
by Imlib.

The remedy is to convert the image file by hand using, for example,
Imagemagick's "convert" command: "convert foo.rgb foo.png".  Then
you'll have to fix up the application to use the new filename instead.
