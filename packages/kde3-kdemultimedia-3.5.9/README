Common Mistakes
---------------

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.trolltech.com
to get a copy of latest Qt 3.3.x version.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  If debugging is not a concern,
--disable-debug will explicitly avoid compiling additional debugging
functions.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.
