Here is a complete list of modules that aRts-0.3.4.1 supported,
with a status how far the port to the KDE2.0 aRts/MCOP version is.

Porting modules is usually a ten-minute task, unless the underlying
features are not yet provided by the new flow system or the general
idea of how things need to be done changed.
