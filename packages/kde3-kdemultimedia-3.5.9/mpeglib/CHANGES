* seek on paused streams works
* close on paused streams works
* added shutdown mutex. This mutex is locked during creation and
  shutdown of the decoder_loop thread, but not when
  the while(runCheck()) loop is running. You should lock this
  mutex if another thread calls methods on variables which are
  constructed/destructed by the decode_loop.
* mpeglib now installs under /usr per default
* Many thanks to Ranty for his patches. Applied patches 
  for playtime(absolute/current),compile fixes, mpegstream dectection
  and realtive seek (+/-) time
* added pts based sync to mpeg2 player (sync is still horrible)
* added a syncClock class. Now the sync is based on scr stamps
* hacked ac3dec/mpeg2dec so they no longer share the same (globally)
* added yaf frontends for ac3,mpeg2
* added ac3 and mpeg2 player (an mpeg2 demuxer is still missing)
* moved the picture construction in the outputstream
* images are now "smoother" Its a good balance between fast/nice images
* SDL sound now works
* wrapper for video and sound. sound over SDL does not work->bug?
* wrapper for threads (SDL does not support try-lock and condition variables)
* directories restructured lib/* now installs as library
* added yaf backends for testing the decoders
* first release
