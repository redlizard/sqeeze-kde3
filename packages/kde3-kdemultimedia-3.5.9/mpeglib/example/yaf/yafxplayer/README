This directory contains a generic player frontend.
Use this as a start if you add new decoder support
to yaf.

The first step is to build the generic frontend.
Uncomment in xplayer_control.c the "main" part
and link the *.o fails againt yafcore.

g++ -o xplayer *.o ../yafcore.a


This should build ./xplayer 


If you implement a new player ans you have to change all the names,
the following script is *very* usefull


for i in *.cpp; do
sed s\/XPlayer\/helloName\/g $i >$i.x
mv $i.x $i
done

which replaces all occurances of "XPlayer" in all .cpp files
to "helloName"

(usefull, isn't it)
