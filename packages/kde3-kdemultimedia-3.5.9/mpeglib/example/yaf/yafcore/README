yaf - <y>et <a>nother <f>rontend

yaf is a simple protocol for communication over streams.

Its purpose is to offer an extensible interface 
for the communitcation between the kmpg GUI and the mpg123 decoder.


DESCRIPTION

The basic idea is, that the GUI and the decoder (splay) work
together over their file streams (cin,cout)
This means, that kmpg sends string-messages to "stdout"
and splay receive these messages as "stdin".
The results of splay (runtime Information, error
codes) are send to "stdout" and kmpg receive them as "stdin"

The protocol is "human readable" just enter "help"
or "help <command>" on the prompt and you will see.
These directory includes classes for dealing with this
text protocol. In normal developement you can completly 
ingore these classe.
