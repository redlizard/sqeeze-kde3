The copyright of this package is a bit interesting.

I release my modification under GPL, although many
parts (which I only copy&paste) are still the BSD license.
Thus, if you use this software, you use GPL source with
all advantages off the GPL license :-)

Here is the "history" of this package:


The copyrights from mpeg_play:
===========================================

First the source comes from the Berkeley mpeg_play player.
and was programmed by:

                  MPEG Video Software Decoder
                  (Version 2.3; March 1996)

 Lawrence A. Rowe<Rowe@CS.Berkeley.EDU>, Ketan Patel, Brian Smith, Steve Smoot, and Eugene Hung
      Computer Science Division-EECS, Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley

mpeg_play related emails:
  mpeg-bugs@plateau.cs.berkeley.edu

The JPEG code comes from :

 jrevdct.c comes from the IJG libjpeg release,
The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet
address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be
found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  



Many other peoples have contributed to the mpeg_play package:

Here is my work:

The mpeg_play source has become over the years more and more _ugly_. 
When I started the work (I wanted to play my Titanic CD-I with Linux)
I saw that mpeg_play needed a complete reengineering. This package
is the result of this work:

* a readable source code
* better structures (although not real OOP)
* a few frames/second slower (buy faster cpus!)
* and usefull input interfaces (for file,http,..)

But my modification (which makes programmers life much easier)
are done under the GPL! 
Ok, the main part is still under the BSD License (all these
strange and complicated algorithm, I don't understand) but if you
use this package (with my modifications) you use GPL source!
