This directory contains a highly modified version of
mpeg_play the Berkley mpeg video player.

Please view the file COPYRIGHT for licence questions.

mpeg_play is in its current state (2.4) old and ugly source.
It's an old software package, which has been ported to too
many architectures, without keeping the source clean.

(No, #ifdef/#defines is not the way to write cross platform code!)

This is a new approach of an mpeg1 video player.

I think this library is much cleaner and is now really usable 
for mpeg1 video/audio playing.

It needed a lot of work to even come to this (not
optimal) source code. But if you knew the mpeg_play source, you
obviously understand :-)
