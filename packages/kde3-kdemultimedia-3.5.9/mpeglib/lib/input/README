Here is the abstraction of the inputplugin.
Its a base class, with the usual open/seek/read methods.
The only nice thing is the factory inputPlugin which
creates you for a given url the correct class.


All inputStreams can take a timeStamp. Its necessary for 
audio/video sync, but this must be supported
by the outputplugin and the playerPlugin!
Video is not that easy as audio :(
