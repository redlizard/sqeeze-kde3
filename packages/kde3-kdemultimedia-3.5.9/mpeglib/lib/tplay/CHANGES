Version 0.1, 2.4.1997:

	- the first released version

5.4.1997:

	- audio sync added before changing parameters

Version 0.2, 9.4.1997:

	- it was useless to start producer as a thread;
          it was made that way just for historical reasons.
          only consumer is threaded now. this may result
	  as more robust behaviour.

	- there are min and max sizes for block now. i'm
	  not sure yet what size for a block and the audio
	  buffer would be good. needs more research.

	- fill_buffer function. fills the audio buffer 
	  before use.

Version 0.2.1, 15.4.1997:

	- signal() seems to be a bad idea in a threaded
	  application like this. causes kernel oops in
	  the sound driver function audio_write (sometimes). 
	  let's have faith on the kernel and remove it.

Version 0.2.2, 17.4.1997 morning:

	- the last block was written from very wrong point.	

	- block counting added. this makes stream ending
	  simpler and (hopefully) more robust.

	- first lines for handling underflow (buffer empty)
	  situation.

Version 0.3, 17.4.1997 afternoon:

	- underflow handling should work now.

	- function buffer_usage added. returns buffer usage
	  in percents. nowhere used yet.

	- minimum block size increased to 16k.

Version 0.3.1, 19.4.1997:

	- GNU style options.

	- option -v (or --version) added.

	- buffer usage option -u (or --usage) added.

Version 0.4, 2.5.1997:

	- support for RIFF/WAVE (WAV) and Sun audio
	  (AU) files.

	- swap endianness flag -x (or --swap) added.

	- verbose mode flag -V (or --verbose) added.

	- force raw flag -r (or --raw) added. WAV- or
	  AU-file headers are ignored if this flag is set.

Version 0.4.1, 3.5.1997:

	- sun header gives odd aligned starting point
	  for sample. temporary fix.

	- read_big_endian_long returned wrong value if
	  sampling rate was 44100. this caused tplay
	  not to work with that speed when playing sun
	  audio or wav file. fixed now.

Version 0.4.2, 7.5.1997:

	- read_big_endian_long and similar functions:
	  parameter's type was char* and that was a bug.
	  changed to byte* (unsigned char *). conversion
	  should also be saner now.

	- force playing -f (or --force) flag added. this
	  makes tplay to ignore sound driver's results
	  when changing parameters.

Version 0.4.3, 12.5.1997:

	- binary is statically linked to LinuxThreads 
	  version 0.6 now.

	- print sun header comment if verbose is requested.

	- sun audio file's data stream starting pointer
	  is read and set from the header.

	- to avoid rounding errors when playing 16bit
	  and/or stereo (au or wav) sample, data section	
	  is moved now to the beginning of buffer before
	  playing.

Version 0.5, 23.10.1997:

	- set_audio_parameters() partly rewritten and 
	  changes to open_audio().

	- in some WAV-files, data-portion is not started
	  with 'data'-magic but 'INFO' instead. some
	  players don't even check that so tplay prints
	  just a warning message now if neither of these
	  magics exists.

Version 0.5.1, 25.10.1997:

	- printing of buffer usage changed from producer
	  to consumer. this makes this silly feature a bit 
	  more informative as it is still active after the
	  producer has stopped. underflow situation (when
	  the big buffer needs to be refilled) is also
	  possible to show now. 

Version 0.5.2, 9.5.1998:

	- Jerko Golubovic <jerko.golubovic@public.srce.hr>
	  kindly modified the code to support those soundcards
	  that may result slightly different sampling rate
	  than requested. he also provided RPM of tplay.

	- added -D (or --device=DEVICE) flag for setting
	  audio device to be used.

	- added feature to -B (or --buffer-size=SIZE) flag.
	  buffer size can be given in seconds now, too.

Version 0.5.3, 11.5.1998:

	- rewrite of playing routine to support multiple 
	  sound samples from command line.

Version 0.5.4, 19.5.1998:

	- added -l (or --loop) flag to support looping sound
	  samples.

	- sun port.

Version 0.5.5, 24.5.1998:

	- added environment variable TPLAYDEV, which sets the 
	  audio device to be used. decoding of command line
	  options is moved from main() to another function.
