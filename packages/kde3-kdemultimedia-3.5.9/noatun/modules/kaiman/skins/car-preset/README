Comment: Skin similar to an automotive stereo, complete
         with presets.
Note: For the presets and volume controls to work, GQmpeg
      0.3.6 is required. Previous versions will work,
      except for these functions.

To use this skin with GQmpeg, use the command line:

     gqmpeg -skin:car-preset

Or when editing skin data, point GQmpeg to this skin with:

     gqmpeg -skin:../car-preset

or to allow the skin to be the default skin copy this directory
to 'HOME/.gqmpeg/skins/car-preset' and specify 'car-preset' as the
skin on the skin tab of the config dialog.
