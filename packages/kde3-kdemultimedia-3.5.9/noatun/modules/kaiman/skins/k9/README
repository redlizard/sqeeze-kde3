Notes: I reversed the iris, so it "closes" as volume increases.
If ya wanna try it the default way, edit the "Volume_Item" line in
the skindata file and change it to "long" instead of "long2"

   & Too bad GQmpeg doesn't have fancy playlist customization like those
"other" mp3 players......this skin has a "kill" one of those too...
