Comments: Skin with a doughnut shape to test shaped windows.
          (skins with a shape mask)

Note: For transparency to work, GQmpeg 0.4.2 is required.
      Previous versions will work, but will be _ugly_.

To use this skin with GQmpeg, use the command line:

     gqmpeg -skin:circle

Or when editing skin data, point GQmpeg to this skin with:

     gqmpeg -skin:../circle

or to allow the skin to be the default skin copy this directory
to 'HOME/.gqmpeg/skins/circle' and specify 'circle' as the
skin on the skin tab of the config dialog.
