This is the original phong skin by misery

Included is his little readme


p h o n g   1 . 5 
-------------------------------------------------

well, err... yes, its phong... created in 
photoshop 4 & 5 during the last two months

does not include an individual dock/shade mode, 
but the wsh, rc and dk are set properly so you 
can use the default.

i've also included a rather decent phong wallpaper
(phong_wallpaper.jpg)
its in 1024 x 768, but you can use it in other 
resolutions too. for 800x600 just be sure that 
you do not stretch the file, for bigger resolutions 
than 1024 x 768 make also sure to pick a 50% grey 
as background color.
