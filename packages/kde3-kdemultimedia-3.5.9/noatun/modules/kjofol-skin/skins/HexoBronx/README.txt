            for Noatun's K-Jöfol Skin Loader

                     ...brought to you by mETz, Crix and Sush
---------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to thank you for downloading/installing this little piece
of art. This is our first try with K-Jöfol skinning and we hope you
enjoy the result.

Features
--------
The skin features the following buttons/functions

 - play, pause, stop
 - fastforward, rewind
 - previous and next track
 - volume and pitch
 - seeker
 - playlist button
 - repeat
 - preferences
 - about
 - window controls: minimize, close
 - works with Noatun and XMMS

What you could possibly miss
----------------------------
Things this skin doesn't support:

 - There is no skinned playlist because playlists suck with K-Jöfol skins.

 - There is no skinned dockmode.

 - It lacks support for original K-Jöfol player. Sounds odd but it's true.
   This skin does not work with that player. During design we forgot to
   make sizes divisible by four which seems to be a quite important skin
   spec. When we actually realized that it was already too late to make
   the appropriate changes :/
   However it works very well with Noatun's K-Jöfol skin loader.
   If there is anyone out there who want's to use this skin for
   the original K-Jöfol player he might drop us a line and we'll see.
