ChangeLog (only lists MY changes)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2003-01-09 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Allow use of system fonts instead of skin-supplied pixmap-fonts, user
  has to take care for choosing an appropriate font and font-color

2003-01-19 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Equalizer support
* Ignore unsupported buttons for spectrum/oscilloscope, won't work with default skin anyway
* Display about-lines in skinselector

2002-04-04 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Started work on config-dialog, this will unhide most things you can now only
  set by clicking on widgets (i.e. time counting mode)

2002-01-21 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Actually read counting-mode of time-display from config

2002-01-20 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Fix ugly crash on Startup related to Time-Display
* less debug

2002-01-06 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Made Playlist-button show if playlist-window is open even after loading a new skin
* Added Tooltips for text-displays
* usual removal of old debug-messages and adding new ones :)

2002-01-04 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* changed scrolling-text behaviour (scrolls 1/2 char every 400ms now)
* playlist-button is a state-button, i.e. shows if playlist-window is open or not
* commented or removed some more unused debug-messages

2001-12-14 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* slightly changed skin-installer (creates dirs without archive extension)
* code cleanups, removed debug-messages

2001-12-12 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* finally made font-spacing between characters working (no garbage inside space)
* textfields with more space than needed for the string to display now get centered text
  (take a look at volumetext or pitchtext to see the centere-effect)
* Noatun is not shown in taskbar if in dockmode as it's no normal window in that mode
* take care if Playlist is shown/hidden and update the playlistbutton
* using kdDebug(66666) for debugmessages instead of stderr-output

2001-10-04 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Still fighting with analyzer and osci visualizations,
  now both are buffered and flicker-free
* fixed stupid bug in isGray(qRgb), now RGB(0,0,0) is treated as gray again :)
* commented out (hopefully) unneded debug-messages
* added splash-screen for skins supporting it (only skin I know of: K-Nine)

2001-09-30 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* ignore alpha-channel of loaded files, they break applying masks to QPixmaps,
  result of this is text without transparency
  (this happened for two skins: adagio and xbs)

2001-09-28 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* analyzer-like scope is now drawn using a gradient instead of exactly one boring color
* removed KJLoader::fixSkin() as Njaard deleted the script doing all the work, I assume
  that this is not needed anymore (guess: maybe QT3 now handles
  most fileformats in a proper way?)

2001-09-22 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* isGray(qRgb) is more tolerant, colors like rgb(162,163,162) are treated as gray too
  This fixes some volume/pitch-sliders and makes using them a lot easier
* made titletext move again (works with and without transparent text)

2001-09-16 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* Made it compile with QT3 and stopped using Njaard's hack to load PNGs

2001-09-04 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* added support for transparent fonts (a skin named steelforged still got problems though)
  for the moment this disables moving of titletext,
  I have to find a new way to move it (bitblt on a masked QPixmap is tricky)

2001-09-03 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* added support for pitch-slider and its textlabel
  kjöfol now depends on libartsmodules because of pitch-support
* finished splitting up kjloader.cpp into several files.
  Now almost every class has its own file
  also took care that compiling with --enable-final works

2001-09-02 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>
* started splitting up kjloader.cpp into several files

Before 2001-09-02 Stefan Gehn <sgehn@gmx.net>

I should have started a ChangeLog earlier :/
Never thought I would change THAT much
(it all started with small noatun-bugfixes)

I'll now try to list the tons of changes done before (totally unordered)

* fixed seeker to work with long files
  (I've got a 330min mp3, seeking did not work behind about 120min)
* made the repeat-button work, it switches between no-looping and song-looping
* made the forward/backward-buttons work, they will skip 10 seconds
* added dockmode-support, in this mode kjöfol will dock to the currently active window
  the window's behaviour looks like this mode needs some more work
* added support for textlabels showing current volume
* added a skininstaller, it still needs proper widgets showing
  the actions going on (unpacking, moving files, deleting files on uninstall)
* tweaked builtin visualizations, both now try to fit into any possible skin
  last activated vis is remembered on restart
* vis honors "AnalyzerColor" and defaults to white if that key is missing in the skin.rc
* support for buttons with "DARKEN"-flag (normally "BMPsomenumber" is used)
* made kjofol parse the skin.rc in lowercase only, now it's fully case-insensitve
* many many tests for existence of keys, 99% of former crashes were caused by not making
  sure a certain key really exists. Many places now assume "default"-values if keys are
  missing, this leads to MUCH better compatibility
