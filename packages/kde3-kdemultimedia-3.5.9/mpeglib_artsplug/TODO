* The arts plugin interface is not touched by me for the
  next time. Thus you have a good chance that your patches 
  will be applied.

  I have to work on better fullscreen support and other things
  in mpeglib. And I have to update the vorbis plugin.


* The seeking and info things are only experimental.
  They show you how it works in mpeglib, but are not usefull
  for a gui. patch welcome.

* MPEG Video Currently exist with :
  XIO:  fatal IO error 0 (Success) on X server ":0.0"
        ^^^^^            ^^^^^^^^ ?->funny
