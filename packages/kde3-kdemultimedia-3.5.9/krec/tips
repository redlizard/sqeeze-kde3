<h4>...that KRec does non-destructive Recording?</h4>
<p>
That means if you have a recording and want to record only a part for a second (third or more) time, your first (and second and later) version is still on disc and can still be restored. Only for Playback/Export the old version is overlayed by the newer one.

<h4>...which event caused the first version of KRec?</h4>
<p>
Some friends of mine asked me whether I could do the recordings for a radioplay for them. So I was searching for an easy-to-use recording tool running on my favorite OS. After some searching (without finding something suitable) I started a first version of KRec.
